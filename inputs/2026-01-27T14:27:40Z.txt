Speaker 3 00:04:24
and raised this is what they look like so yeah so i mean we all do that right are you from salt.
Speaker 2 00:04:33
lake city area yeah like i think you just go wherever your family's generally at and then like you travel and you realize it's just the same crap everywhere yeah oh yeah yeah i want to.
Speaker 3 00:04:48
say i i did a product and ux conference there once um right on campus um adobe sponsored it at the time which is pretty cool so.
Speaker 2 00:05:00
Yeah, Adobe's got a huge building kind of south of, like, downtown Salt Lake, probably, I don't know, 30 minutes.
Speaker 3 00:05:09
Yeah, I did that, what was that, three or four years ago? I would love to do that again. It was a good little startup mindset there.
Speaker 2 00:05:19
Yeah, they, I don't know. I know some people that worked at Adobe. The one guy was a dad with me, his wife, they had their first baby.
Speaker 1 00:05:30
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:05:31
And they gave her, like, a year of, like, paid time. Like, it's just incredible how much better they are at benefits. Sure. It just makes sense. Yeah.
Speaker 3 00:05:48
My old company rolled out for the longest time. It was just like two weeks or whatever. And then you could add your PTO. And as soon as we had two kids and as soon as we are officially done, I am officially done. They rolled out eight weeks. I was like, are you kidding me? Do I get like back pay for that. 
Speaker 2 00:06:08
Yeah, retro. Like I'll just take half. Like just give me like three more.
Speaker 3 00:06:11
Yeah. So no, no luck though.
Speaker 2 00:06:15
No, they don't care about any of us really. Well, cool.
Speaker 3 00:06:21
Hey, I did want to set this up. I appreciate your time. I'm new. I started last week. And so I've just been kind of sitting down and I want to hear a little bit about you, what you do. I see you're like a manager. So you have quite the reports under you. I was just looking to learn more about kind of where you fit in and what you're currently working on.
Speaker 2 00:06:42
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll give you the. Let's see. Shortest possible history of Champ that I can. So I ended up joining Champ through a guy that I'd worked with prior. He was at Overstock. They did a bunch of venture stuff together with the Champ team. So then he ended up joining Champ, brought me over. That was like June of 2021.
Speaker 3 00:07:06
Oh, sweet.
Speaker 2 00:07:08
So then I was like one of the tech leads. We were setting up West Virginia, our first state ever. We were like, we didn't have anything. So then we did that. It was crazy then, still crazy now. I don't think that's going to change. But so then I worked my way up, basically ended up kind of running the product engineering when they split between the state and the product side.
Speaker 1 00:07:37
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:07:38
Then got to where there was like, I don't know, 30, 35 people. I was traveling a lot like for the past like year and a half back and forth to Cleveland.
Speaker 3 00:07:48
Sure.
Speaker 2 00:07:50
Debating on moving here. My wife was kind of looking for work. Didn't really work out.
Speaker 3 00:07:56
What a shift to go from beautiful Salt Lake to Cleveland.
Speaker 2 00:07:59
I know. And so they ended up hiring Britt. This is all recent history. So they now move me over to like the state side where I can be remote.
Speaker 3 00:08:14
Everyone on the state side is remote, right. 
Speaker 2 00:08:17
Yeah. Not everybody. Ian, Chris Keller. But like there's, yeah, there's more of them. We've got quite a few devs too that are remote still.
Speaker 3 00:08:31
Yeah. I should be meeting here with Ian sometime this week. I've been working on him with the fee stuff.
Speaker 2 00:08:37
Yeah. Yeah, Ian, I mean, him, Dan, Bo, LT, and Shane are like the OGs. I'm a relatively close second now. I think maybe, well, I don't know if Jeremiah beats me in seniority or not.
Speaker 3 00:08:58
Did I, he's the cloud, he's a cloud architect, or he cloud engineer, something like that. 
Speaker 2 00:09:03
Yeah, he's, yeah, he's the director over the cloud. So they're all based in Arkansas. There's one that's in Texas.
Speaker 3 00:09:13
Gotta go there for some barbecue. Go visit them next quarter.
Speaker 2 00:09:19
Yeah. The one guy, Phillip, he's in Austin. So I keep telling him, I was like, dude, I need to just go for a weekend and fly down there.
Speaker 3 00:09:29
Yeah. You need some product architecture help there too, right. 
Speaker 2 00:09:35
Right. Uh, we can make it a work thing. Charge the charge champ. Absolutely. Uh, but yeah, that's kind of the gist. I mean, basically we all just kind of do whatever we need to, to wing, wing it and whatever project we're on.
Speaker 3 00:09:54
Biggest fish contract. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. What's on, it's getting better. Yeah. What's one of your, uh, what's your, what do you, if you had a primary focus, where would it be at. 
Speaker 2 00:10:04
Oh, I don't know, man. I feel like we're constantly tweaking stuff. Like that's kind of our mentality anyway. So it's like any sort of pain point we just start iterating.
Speaker 3 00:10:20
Sure. Um, I feel like the term focus is hard here. Like I never get a clear. Clear answer from anyone when I ask them that.
Speaker 2 00:10:28
So you're not alone. There's always like 15 number one priorities.
Speaker 3 00:10:34
Sure. Oh yeah.
Speaker 2 00:10:34
And so then inevitably right seven or eight of them fall behind a bit because you're doing the other seven or eight. And, uh, you know, I think it's just part of running as lean as we do and just trying to chase whatever the cool new thing is.
Speaker 3 00:11:01
Oh yeah. Oh, I come from the, uh, the AI space. So my AI is my background, at least for the last two to three years. So I definitely get the chasing the fun, flashy new things. So, Hmm.
Speaker 2 00:11:14
Yeah. AI. I mean, it made a big, big splash, I don't know, mid to late summer.
Speaker 3 00:11:22
Sure.
Speaker 2 00:11:23
I think. All the LLM stuff, you know, they're catching each other now. Now Google's finally making a big splash, and I don't know. I think in the right situations, it's super helpful. Yep. But the human element is definitely still required because they hallucinate. But, yeah, where were you at doing the AI stuff before. 
Speaker 3 00:11:56
I was down the street here at Highland Software.
Speaker 2 00:11:59
Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 3 00:12:00
So, yeah, that was my – they kind of pulled me from our configurable administrative base over into the AI space. And, yeah, that was kind of my specialty for a while. So now here I am actually product architect. It's going to kind of be that hybrid role of, you know, product focus but interacting with the architecture and kind of making sure that we can scale.
Speaker 2 00:12:25
which was kind of a common theme last week so yeah just because Kentucky wants a magical button, doesn't mean we want it anywhere else so maybe we could have let Kentucky.
Speaker 3 00:12:37
make this button over here let them configure it however they want to see it yeah yeah so yeah.
Speaker 2 00:12:45
we've got a bunch of i mean json files especially for the ui like we did pretty hot and heavy in.
Speaker 3 00:12:52
that config side yeah so are you when you say your state side are you working on us with a specific state are you kind of like guiding the teams that work on the state.
Speaker 2 00:13:03
specific implementations yeah the latter okay i don't do as much of that i mean i'll get dirty when i need to but like honestly i'm not really coding yeah like i used to you know four years ago.
Speaker 3 00:13:19
but uh it's gonna start vibing it out right you got the mindset.
Speaker 2 00:13:25
I mean, I'll at least know if it's close. Yeah. And then I'll just kind of throw it up.
Speaker 3 00:13:30
Don't look at my GitHub repo because it is garbage.
Speaker 2 00:13:34
Yeah, same. I don't – no one curates that, I feel like, unless you're, like, looking for work. Yeah, did you ever work – I know Highland, she's not here any longer, but Naomi.
Speaker 3 00:13:51
Naomi, yeah, we used to be on a product team together. So I was a product owner, and then they shifted all of our titles. Yeah, we were actually on a team probably two to three years ago, maybe four years ago.
Speaker 1 00:14:05
Okay.
Speaker 3 00:14:05
Yeah, I was kind of sad I started up, and I was like, where's Naomi at. 
Speaker 2 00:14:09
I know. She just bounced, like, the end of last year. Yeah.
Speaker 3 00:14:15
Did you work closely with her. 
Speaker 2 00:14:17
Yeah. I mean, you know how she is. She's just super friendly. Like, she – I think culture-wise, the office definitely probably took the biggest hit because she just would include people, let's go to lunch, this, that. You know what I mean. 
Speaker 3 00:14:35
Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 2 00:14:36
That's kind of why you go to RTO is for some of that. But, yeah, I'm sure she's doing fine. I texted her, like, you know how it is with colleagues. Holidays, birthdays, stay just enough in touch. And then if I'm in Cleveland, obviously.
Speaker 3 00:14:56
Yeah, oh, yeah. There you go. Yeah, I haven't heard much from her besides when I originally came in for my interview.
Speaker 2 00:15:06
Yeah. Yeah, honestly, I've seen, like, product architects, but I've never personally worked with one. I'm assuming. That will be involved a lot as we're building out some of this new stuff. But, yeah, I mean.
Speaker 3 00:15:28
Well, I was going to say, you know, I'm working with Kevin pretty closely now, Abby, of course, here. But if there is ever an opportunity or if you're on a call and there's some type of discrepancy between, you know, hey, should we put this in the core or the plug-in, please include me. I'd love to just be tuned in as much as possible. So I might not have an answer, but I'd at least love to understand what questions are being asked.
Speaker 2 00:15:53
Well, sometimes it's enough just to, like, document a decision that happened.
Speaker 1 00:15:60
Yeah, right.
Speaker 2 00:16:01
And then you can work back from that and then figure out. Because we can't, I mean, God, we don't all want to be in every meeting. No, yeah.
Speaker 3 00:16:12
Shoot me a message, whatever format works, you know. yeah it's been nice my calendar has been filling up but then i get to like pick and choose like.
Speaker 2 00:16:22
okay let's go let's do this one today or that one tomorrow you know yeah we all i mean we all experienced that like i'll get him in everything and then you're like i don't want to be in any of that and then uh the decline button right right i mean we have to have some amount of time during the day to do thoughtful work or else we do it at our house when we should be with our family.
Speaker 3 00:16:52
yeah oh yeah that was something i ran into uh ran into in the past so yeah well sick uh.
Speaker 2 00:17:01
what's the so i know you're tyler and then we have the other tyler so what's the what's the nickname that's been, sticking the most in the office, any of them. 
Speaker 3 00:17:11
No, we just both pop up. We both look, we're on like the same wall here. So we both pop up and we're like, oh, what's up? And most of the time they're talking, talking to him. And I'm just like, oh, the gopher.
Speaker 2 00:17:22
Well, you're only a couple of weeks in.
Speaker 3 00:17:24
Yeah, there we go.
Speaker 2 00:17:28

Speaker 3 00:17:40
But no, I just wanted to, I appreciate your time. I didn't really have much, much on here. I wanted to kind of just touch base and maybee understand a little bit about what you were doing, which, which helped out. So.
