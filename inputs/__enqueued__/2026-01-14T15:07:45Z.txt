Speaker 1 00:01:55
Hello, everyone. We are going to get started. Welcome to our 2026 CEI report launch briefing call. My name is Marcos Garcia. You see him pronouns. I'm the deputy director for the workplace quality program. And I am so grateful that you are all here on this webinar, joining us today for a little bit of information about how we will be releasing this year's report. Before I get into we get into details of that. I will start off with housekeeping. First of all, microphones are all.
Speaker 1 00:02:26
automatically muted. This is a recorded presentation. Number one question. We've already gotten questions in the Q&A box about this. This webinar is recorded and the slide decks will be shared. So don't worry about that. If you have colleagues who can't make it today, and they registered for this webinar, they will be receiving an email with the recording and the slide deck. And then finally, please use the Q&A function for questions and comments. We know that you have two options, either the comments or the Q&A.
Speaker 1 00:02:57
We prefer the Q&A box, so in your control panel down at the bottom, you should see a Q&A box where you can add your questions there. For today, I am not presenting alone. I have my amazing colleague, Eric Bloom, who is the Vice President for Corporate Citizenship here at HRC, who will join me in this presentation, and I will be sharing a few of the logistics about the CEI launch. But with that, I will toss it over to Eric. Eric, take it away.
Speaker 2 00:03:26
Good afternoon. Again, Eric Bloom, Egan Pronouns, VP of the Foundation. Really wonderful to have you all with us today. Before we dive into this year's launch strategy and the resources, we want to start by thanking you for your dedication to your work towards building fair and equal workplaces. um for your work alongside us uh in a time certainly know that uh this work isn't easy uh we know that is seemingly getting.
Speaker 2 00:03:57
uh harder by the day but um on behalf of the quality program, on behalf of leadership including our president kelly robinson just a deep appreciation for your work um as you all know the corporate quality index is it represents much more than just a score um it certainly understands flex understanding of today's landscape in the commit workplaces where lgbtq plus people and frankly everybody have the opportunities um as this year has shown.
Speaker 2 00:04:27
uh progress isn't linear uh organ uh and it requires sustained thoughtful action uh and really what the corporate corporate quality index is all about um over the past 23 years the cei has tracked significant shifts towards more equitable uh workplaces, In a year of heightened scrutiny around inclusion, we are just especially grateful of your CEI, your commitment to LGBTQ plus employees, and certainly for 2026, we're going to be introducing.
Speaker 2 00:04:60
a refined approach, but certainly to really be attuned to the rapidly evolving workplace landscape. This year's report is very important for us to go beyond just the survey results, but also to offer a clear context to how the past year has affected LGBTQ plus employees, how it has affected businesses and their work around. That's really going to be a core tenet of the report we'll talk a little bit about. Our goal is to clarify how our collective work toward inclusion and to really highlight.
Speaker 2 00:05:34
the continued importance of your partnership and feedback. Well, last year especially has been just incredibly invaluable to our work. We've had so many conversations with business leaders to really kind of talk about how we can hone CEI around broader engagement with all of you to ensure this work of the CEI continues to meet the today's business. It certainly has helped shape our launch strategy, which really has centered and will center our most important stakeholders, which are our employees and team members, and we're.
Speaker 2 00:06:07
excited to share that. We are always available to be a resource for companies as their work towards inclusion and supporting their employees. Know that your work has been impactful, as it has been impactful to the millions of workers, and certainly impactful to the bottom line. So, again, thank you so much for joining us today and thank you for your work. So, just to double click on our program.
Speaker 2 00:06:40
One of the important things that we really wanted to focus on was really just kind of having a core sort of understanding of the broader environment that businesses and LGBTQ plus workers are facing. In the early years of our work here at the Human Rights Campaign to create fair and equal workplaces, we published an annual state of the workplace report that really provided an overview of the events and updates related to work and the broader policy landscape around it.
Speaker 2 00:07:10
The cover of our 2001 report going way, way back, but the report really did serve a thousand foot perspective on what are the implications, what are the developments that really have impacted the lives of LGBT. So as part of our strategy for 2020, we're returning to that tradition with that report to provide that broader proof. It will include. shifts in the legal and policy landscape that impacts LGBTQ plus workers. It'll talk about.
Speaker 2 00:07:44
new findings from HRC's community survey, really talking about the impact that the DEI practice had, on workers, their ability to succeed, their ability to give in the workplace, and so we're excited to share some of that data with you as part of the broader picture. We're also going to be underscoring and reiterating and providing data to support the business case, so the importance of.
Speaker 2 00:08:15
transparency, why being transparent, talking about your commitment, really help from a bottom line perspective. So last summer we released our financial performance data related to transparency and the corporate quality index for commitment inclusion. We're going to be sharing that data again. and underscoring that. And then certainly, we will be talking about policies and practices.
Speaker 2 00:08:45
We will be talking about the Corporate Equality Index findings and to really kind of understand sort of how that landscape. Just a few notes on sort of the release strategy. We know that your employees are important stakeholders. So our strategy was to accommodate that. Just from a press and media, we will be issuing a press release to promote, you know, through HRC's organizational channels.
Speaker 2 00:09:17
we're going to be reporting through our social media. And so just it's very important for us as we report to make sure that the most important stakeholders are our community, our workers have the information. We will be sharing CEI results in aggregate. really important we'll talk about that in more detail um but we will not be mentioning specific company scores or names as part of our digital report or as part of the release um and marcos, will be sharing more from on how businesses will show up as part of the um so i really just wanted.
Speaker 2 00:09:55
to kind of underscore that and i think just from uh really focusing on uh targeted outreach to hr trade publications and media really making sure that uh so um that's just a broad sort of uh lay of the land on sort of strategy around the uh again we want to be mindful of the environment that we have right now we've taken a lot of steps to adjust our strategy to really try to meet them open to um to be responsive to your concerns right now but yet to be able to still provide.
Speaker 2 00:10:35
And so just a point on timing, HRC will announce the 2026 via press release at 9am on Wednesday, February time, the results and all the information are go to that time. So we just asked to have a close hold and your internal stakeholders until the time of that really making sure to kind of involve just absolutely critical to make sure that your communication strategies in place and go for that launch.
Speaker 2 00:11:11
If you do have questions are relevant to our relevant to our media strategy, please do not have to us at press at RC.org. We have our shop really at the ready and really plugged in right now. We can integrate in. um i think that um i'm going to pass it back to marcos who's going to walk us through, uh all of the details that we need um coming up at the first week so marcos.
Speaker 1 00:11:51
Thank you so much, Eric, and to reiterate Eric's appreciation to you all for participating in the CEI. On behalf of Courtney and myself, we are so thankful that you, you know, participated in the CEI this year. We've worked alongside us this entire cycle, that you bear with us on the CEI inbox as we get back to you as quickly as we can, and also in the time that it took to do the CEI this year. We really appreciate the work that you all have kind of committed to LGBTQ plus workplace inclusion and to continuing that in such a climate that we're in. As we typically do with the CEI every year, we release a release toolkit for participating companies. This year is no different. So we will share with you all a toolkit that we anticipate will be sent out by Friday, January 23rd. So not this Friday, but next.
Speaker 1 00:12:39
Friday, Friday, January 23rd, we will share our release toolkit and in it we will have external components and internal components for the external components that will include a press release template. If your team would like to issue its own press release, we will also have external comms talking points that you can share in that either press release or as a, communications that you share out with just information about the history of the CEI or frequently asked questions that we get about the CEI that you can share with your team. Sample social media content that you can.
Speaker 1 00:13:13
share along with shareable images. Our CEI report cover that we will include, that will all be in the release toolkit. A quote from HRC president, Kelly Robinson that you can also include in your releases. Typically we see, releases include a CEO statement or a senior leader statement alongside Kelly's quote so we'll share that quote with you all in that document there and then finally some top line data points that you can also include if you'd like to include in your external communications. As for HRC we will be.
Speaker 1 00:13:43
sharing the report launch across all of our platforms, all of our social media platforms and if you share your participation in the CEI this year we ask you to tag us in the socials and we will share, excuse me, we will like them. We would love to see them. Thank you. these days. We'd love to see them across all platforms these days. We're seeing quite a few on LinkedIn and folks sharing their excitement about their company participating in the CEI. And so, you know, share those out and we'll like them. Because of the volume, we are unable to.
Speaker 1 00:14:16
retweet or repost, but we are able to like. So please do that and share on LinkedIn and other social media platforms with your participation in the CEI. As Eric mentioned, we know also that some companies are focusing on internal communication. So we wanted to provide you all with those resources as well. So a part of this toolkit will contain internal communications resources. One of those being for HR leaders, just guidance on how to share CEI participation.
Speaker 1 00:14:47
and the company's score internally. We also know that ERG leaders and ERGs, make a big part about how the CEI happens at a lot of our corporations and so we've also included some talking points and language for ERGs to share out the excitement about having participated in the CEI this cycle and then finally we also have or we will be sharing our executive toolkit for businesses so through the CEI cycle if folks remember we shared our executive toolkit that kind of had the background rationale for the CEI a bit of you know what the pillars are and other.
Speaker 1 00:15:21
additional frequently asked questions and so that will also be included in this toolkit just in case you have some senior leaders that are still wondering what the CEI is and you wanted to include that language in your report out I'm pausing and moving slowly and deliberately on this slide which is about our CEI company listings and I first want to start off as Eric mentioned I was going to go through how companies will be listed in the CEI this cycle but I do want to share that nothing has changed from, uh what we announced in june about the way companies will be listed to now and so for our.
Speaker 1 00:15:58
digital report as eric mentioned in the digital report all results in the cei report and the press release will be reported in aggregate there will not be individual company names in the cei digital report so i know we get a few questions uh by the end of this webinar where folks are wondering if they heard that correctly but again the digital report will not company names the press release will not include company names alongside the digital report there in previous years has been a pdf appendix listing this year.
Speaker 1 00:16:31
We will not be including that appendix listing on the digital report page. That PDF listing of companies will only be shared exclusively with our HRC members, our supporters, and you all, our CEI participants. So as we release the CEI on Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern, there will likely be an email that you all receive that will have that PDF document that will contain the list of companies in the CEI this cycle. And so, again, that will only be shared with CEI participating companies and HRC members and supporters.
Speaker 1 00:17:08
And then finally, our Employer Search Tool. This is available at hrc.org slash CEI. You can actually log in, go to hrc.org slash CEI and see the current iteration of the Employer Search Tool. But I've included a screenshot of the way that the Employer Search Tool will show up in CEI 2026. So if you're logged in or if you want to check out hrc.org slash CEI, if you look right now, listen to our corporate, underneath each of the pillars right now as it stands, there's a little checkbox of what actual policies and practices.
Speaker 1 00:17:40
are in place at companies. And so we listened to our partners and said, we're going to shift that into a narrative explanation, of what each of the pillars are, but we're not going to give that level of detail. And it's really, the intention behind that was to kind of... Losing track of my words. Ultimately, to be aligned with corporations and protect companies on what practices and policies are actually in place, but also to provide that information to the LGBTQ plus community as there are job seekers, as there are consumers, as there are stakeholders and shareholders who are interested in this information.
Speaker 1 00:18:17
They use the employer search tool in order to find whether or not a company is LGBTQ plus inclusive. So we provide this employer search tool, which still will be public. And this is an example of how a company would show up. In this case, this company is an Equality 100 company. So you can see their score breakdown there, but then that paragraph narrative included there, the checkboxes are no longer included.
Speaker 1 00:18:48
To shift into a little bit about the report top line, right? Our role. been thinking about throughout this report tracking process is to make sure that LGBTQ, workers and business leaders understand how the development and workplace inclusion and how the climate has affected the workplace so that this work can continue effectively. And so our report is going to provide an overview of shifts in legal and policy landscape. As Eric mentioned, we have our community survey climate data that we will include in this year's report. And this.
Speaker 1 00:19:22
year this data is showing us that there are shifts in corporate workplace inclusion that are associated with increased stigma and bias that then contribute to hostile workplace environments and that leads to elevated employee flight risk and a reduction in productivity. So, that data will be included in the report. Just have to wait two weeks, but there are some statistics that we will share there about the impact about workplace inclusion, how it's affected LGBTQ plus workers and business leaders. So that's going to be included in the report.
Speaker 1 00:19:53
Thank you so much, Eric. We also share the financial impact of the CEI. Folks, remember we shared out our financial report data in collaboration with Whistlestop Capital about the financial impact of the CEI and how CEI leaders outperform their peers in revenue, profit, and stock stability. And that over time, but in over 10 years, the top quartile CEI companies, so the companies that scored the highest in the CEI report an eight times higher.
Speaker 1 00:20:25
net income. So again, sharing that business case for participation in the CEI, but also the business case for workplace inclusion. And then finally, my most... Admired component of this report will be the CEI data, as I'm the data nerd. But really sharing the fact that one of the main things that we see in the CEI is that there is not a rollback of protections or benefits that are being provided by companies.
Speaker 1 00:20:57
You know, 98% of our CEI employers maintain LGBTQ plus non-discrimination protections. We're also seeing that inclusive benefits, domestic partner benefits, and comprehensive health benefits remain standard within our companies. We're not seeing a rollback, and we're excited to share that in this year's report. and we'll also share that there have been some some shifts in corporate transparency and that's mostly due to the climate that companies are in right now there is uh you know a shift in.
Speaker 1 00:21:28
the transparency and the ability for companies to share the way that they can be inclusive, uh and that's in large part due to the pressures that companies are facing at this time so we're excited to share that that story within the cei report in two short weeks whoops. And with that, if you all have any questions, you can reach out to us at CEI at HRC.org. Courtney and I are in that inbox mostly.
Speaker 1 00:21:58
Courtney doing great work, making sure to get back to you as quickly as she can. But if you have any questions about the report release, you can reach out to us at CEI at HRC.org. And as Eric mentioned, if there are any press inquiries, if your comms teams have any questions about how to approach the report release this year, you can reach out to press at HRC.org. And I'll also share right now, again, the date for the toolkit to read your inboxes will be Friday, by Friday, January 23rd.
Speaker 1 00:22:30
So again, not this Friday, but next Friday, we will work to get you that release toolkit in your inboxes. Finally, we know that sometimes senior leaders have a few questions that they may want to reach out to HRC about, so if your senior leadership team has any questions about participating in the CEI, please reach out to us at workplace at hrc.org. Our senior leadership team is available to meet and discuss any questions that you may have, and again, you can reach out to us at workplace at hrc.org, and we'll be able to help you there.
Speaker 1 00:23:06
With that, I will pause for questions. And while folks are drafting any questions, again, I'll just reiterate the great appreciation that we at HRC have in you all, in your companies participating in the CEI. I, according to myself, just want to share a personal thank you to you all. You are likely the ones that are doing the work, doing the survey submission, emailing us, and we appreciate the work that you've done to get that survey across the finish line, but also the patients and working with us in our responses.
Speaker 1 00:23:37
We really are very grateful to have worked with you and to continue to work with you as we approach the next CEI cycle. As it stands right now, I'm not seeing any questions, so I will just end with a reminder. I'll end with a reminder that, again, the release toolkit will be shared with you by Friday, January 23rd. And then please keep all this information under embargo.
Speaker 1 00:24:10
We're asking that companies keep this under embargo until Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern. So I just want to reiterate that you may receive this or you will receive this toolkit before February 4th. But we ask to keep all communications about it on close hold until Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern. And I'll just, even though there's no questions, I'm just going to take a second to just reiterate once again, just in case folks have questions. Again, in the digital report, reports, excuse me, results will only be listed in aggregate.
Speaker 1 00:24:44
Individual company names will not be included. The appendix PDF listing will only be shared with our CEI participants and HRC members and supporters. And then finally, the employer search tool, which you can access right now. now uh for the 2025 version you can access it right now um will be updated to what you see on the screen here on the right where again that narrative will be shifted into these paragraphs, and this excuse me this employer search tool will be accessible to folks who go to hrc.org cei.
Speaker 1 00:25:15
but with that seeing no questions i thank you all again for joining us on this webinar and, if you have any questions reach out to our cei hrc.org thanks everyone take.
Speaker 3 01:01:55
All right, I got my cat set up.
Speaker 4 01:04:04
Did you turn the plot off? If your thing's over, please turn it off. You have to press and hold the button again. Because it's just been recording this whole time.
Speaker 3 01:04:28
And then if you do that, I can let it sync while I'm driving.

## 1. 2026 CEI Report Launch Logistics and Strategy
### Conclusion
The 2026 CEI report will be launched on Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. The launch strategy is refined to be mindful of the current climate, focusing on employees as key stakeholders. The report's digital version and press release will only present data in aggregate, without mentioning individual company names or scores. A detailed PDF listing of companies will be shared exclusively with CEI participants, HRC members, and supporters. The public-facing Employer Search Tool will be updated to show a narrative explanation instead of detailed policy checkboxes.
### Plan
- [ ] Distribute the release toolkit to participating companies. -- *Marcos Garcia, Courtney* by Friday, January 23rd
- [ ] Maintain embargo on all launch information until the official release. -- *[Insert Attendee Names]* Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern
- [ ] Issue HRC press release and promote the launch via organizational channels and social media. -- *HRC Press Team* Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern
- [ ] Direct press inquiries to press@HRC.org. -- *Company Comms Teams*
- [ ] Direct senior leadership questions about CEI participation to workplace@hrc.org. -- *Company Senior Leaders*
### Discussion Points
1. [Marcos Garcia]: A comprehensive release toolkit will support external and internal communications for participating companies.
   - External components: press release template, external comms talking points, sample social media content, CEI report cover, a quote from HRC President Kelly Robinson, and top-line data points.
   - Internal components: guidance for HR leaders and talking points for ERGs.
   - Distribution by Friday, January 23rd.
2. [Eric Bloom]: The launch strategy centers employees as the most important stakeholders and is mindful of the current environment.
   - The CEI report and press release will share results in aggregate, without specific company scores or names.
   - HRC will conduct targeted outreach to HR trade publications.
3. [Marcos Garcia]: The digital CEI report and press release will not include individual company names; a PDF appendix listing companies will be shared exclusively with participants and HRC members, not on the public report page.
4. [Marcos Garcia]: The Employer Search Tool on hrc.org/CEI will remain public but will shift to a narrative explanation of a company's inclusivity efforts rather than detailed policy checkboxes.
   - This aims to protect companies while still providing valuable information to job seekers and consumers.
5. [Marcos Garcia]: Companies are encouraged to tag HRC in social media posts about CEI participation; HRC will "like" these posts but cannot retweet or repost due to volume.
## 2. Content and Focus of the 2026 CEI Report
### Conclusion
The 2026 CEI report returns to an annual "State of the Workplace" format, providing broader context on the landscape for LGBTQ+ workers. It will include analyses of legal/policy shifts, new HRC community survey data linking inclusion to employee retention and productivity, a restated business case for inclusion supported by financial performance data, and the latest CEI findings. A key finding is that companies are largely maintaining non-discrimination protections and benefits, though there is a noticeable shift in corporate transparency due to external pressures.
### Discussion Points
1. [Eric Bloom]: The 2026 report will provide a broader "state of the workplace" context, reflecting HRC's early reports.
   - Coverage of shifts in the legal and policy landscape affecting LGBTQ+ workers.
   - New findings from HRC's community survey on the impact of DEI practices on workers.
   - Reiteration of the business case for transparency and inclusion, including financial performance data from collaboration with Whistlestop Capital.
2. [Marcos Garcia]: The report will show that shifts in workplace inclusion correlate with increased stigma, hostile work environments, and elevated employee flight risk.
3. [Marcos Garcia]: Key data: no significant rollback of protections or benefits among participating companies.
   - 98% of CEI employers maintain LGBTQ+ non-discrimination protections.
   - Inclusive benefits, such as domestic partner benefits and comprehensive health benefits, remain standard.
4. [Marcos Garcia]: The report will address the shift in corporate transparency, largely attributed to current external pressures.
5. [Eric Bloom]: The report emphasizes collective work toward inclusion and the value of partnership and feedback from businesses.
## 3. General Announcements and Housekeeping

> **AI Suggestions**
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. **Date Clarity:** The toolkit distribution and embargo lift dates were cited as "Friday, January 23rd" and "Wednesday, February 4th." In 2026, January 23rd is a Friday and February 4th is a Wednesday, but the phrasing created confusion. Confirm and communicate exact dates to all participating companies to prevent embargo violations or logistical errors.
> 2. **PDF Appendix Distribution Process:** The PDF appendix listing companies will be shared exclusively with CEI participants, HRC members, and supporters, but the distribution mechanism is unclear. Specify whether it will be sent automatically (and to whom), available via a secure portal, or require a request, and clarify access for HRC members/supporters.
> 3. **Transparency Shift Examples:** The report references a "shift in corporate transparency" due to external pressures without concrete examples. Provide specifics (e.g., changes in marketing disclosures, internal comms, public policy advocacy, or reporting practices) to prepare companies for internal and external questions.
