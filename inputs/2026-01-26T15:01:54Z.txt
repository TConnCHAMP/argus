Speaker 1 00:00:27
hello hey there can you hear me yeah i can hear you perfect awesome thanks so much how are you good good yeah it's uh it's quite a little snowstorm here this weekend so it was a fun drive in so you actually went in yeah trooper i've been working remote for years now so i'm just itching to be in person so you know i wish we were a little closer i would love to have a yeah a place to focus yeah.
Speaker 1 00:01:01
Cool. Yeah. I just want to hear this. I appreciate you getting together here. I just want to touch base. I know you, your name has been brought up a few times for the data model, universal data model. So yeah, I wanted to pick your brain, see what you're working on, or I guess see the status of that. And then yeah, here, maybe if there's opportunities of me jumping in and just learning on other calls or anything like that. Happy to do it.
Speaker 2 00:01:29
Yeah. So actually it's, it's kind of the, you know, I'm not facilitating a lot of meetings at the moment. It's actually me just kind of joining other people's to be honest. I'm still kind of getting an idea of, I think that the structure is now that I'm reporting to Kevin as the data architect, I guess. And Jake and Carrie and Varsha, who are part of my team, are not going to be pushed under Britt, which is good. I think that she'll provide a lot of coverage and direction that I couldn't provide for them otherwise. But yeah, I'm still kind of newish. Not really. I can't hide behind that excuse forever. It's like a year and a half old or something. But I still feel brand new. There's still so much to learn.
Speaker 2 00:02:10
But I came from like a long ways ago, a long time ago, from super opposite ends of the world, which is like, you know, market development funds and something that's super nebulous in terms of, you know, what we did as a company.
Speaker 1 00:02:27
Oh, sure.
Speaker 2 00:02:28
So it's very, very interesting. Right. But I'm used to very monolithic kind of products where we all kind of shared the same data set. So we all kind of had the same standard terminology. Right. Um, this place, they, they kind of started up a lot of microservice kind of direction. Yeah. So didn't realize there was so much to the actual DMV domain as well. So there's a lot there, but, um, we have a bunch of different products. It was very, very hard. We have a whole, you know, confluence page for acronyms and stuff.
Speaker 2 00:03:00
It's just still hard for me to kind of wrap my head around. So whenever I was kind of brought on board was, um, my project was to bring our, um, um, ODS or operational data store into a more usable state, um, and kind of get everything, coalesced in one area. And that way it could be more real time and people could start to rely and have trust and faith in the data a lot more. Um, and then IDLS hit with Louisiana and the whole company kind of switched, you know, switched gears.
Speaker 2 00:03:31
Yeah, switch and shift. So, you know, super, super different, but we're slowly working on the UADM, which is an actual living version of what I would think the warehouse represents, which is not every product that we have, which has its own database right now. It's own set of terminology. It's own set of rules. Everything should be sharing its one, you know, database back in. That way, everything, the governance that comes along with it, the stewardship is a lot easier, can be shared amongst, you know, more business teams, and we can kind of all collectively see it all in one place.
Speaker 2 00:04:07
It'll make the warehousing aspect better. It'll make everything better. But still kind of the same goal, but just very much a live back end.
Speaker 1 00:04:16
Yeah, let me ask this. When you're, each state, of course, is going to have state specific, even each product, right, is going to have product specific verbiage or terminologies. How are you guys handling? Like those configurable options is is there a are you building that into the database itself, the scheme itself, or is that kind of a different structure or architecture. 
Speaker 2 00:04:45
So I think each person. So we have the concept here. And again, this is me hiding behind my newbie thing, but we have implementation roles. So Ian's group, Ian Lewis, they I guess they're akin to people. Whenever you have a client, you can help kind of initialize them in your platform. That's what he's his team does. Isaac Hecker is one that kind of comes to mind, but they know all the ins and outs per state. OK, so there's somebody that's like representative of the actual product that we've always had.
Speaker 2 00:05:16
But there's always somebody that's also representative of the state and all of their fun uses of that product. Right. So from what I understand, when we're talking about the UIDM specifically. With the state plug-ins, they're also going to have some version of the back-end database, but those plug-ins should be aware of the UADM. The UADM should never be aware of the state-specific plug-ins from the direction that I'm understanding. That makes sense. So any lookups, any mapping, it should go to that core repository, which should be the golden standard.
Speaker 2 00:05:52
I can't say state anymore. Golden state is the state of being. Standard, I get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, there you go. If I say current state one more time and everybody's like, wait, which state? Not state-state.
Speaker 1 00:06:05
Next state? N plus one. 
Speaker 2 00:06:08
But I don't know if that answers your question, though. I think it'll live in some version of the state aspect of it, but we'll always have to have that mapping to our core. What verbiage and logic and formulas look like. Yeah. And that's, I've been told I have free reign over that part, like the main UADM part. What the states need to implement, I think, is more on the technical side. Again, Isaac's world.
Speaker 1 00:06:39
Right.
Speaker 2 00:06:40
Does that help at all. 
Speaker 1 00:06:41
It does, yeah. No, and if anything, I think I want to, I'm going to marinate on how I can better frame the questions to, not here, of course, but just like in general, as I'm kind of thinking through the terminologies and stuff. So, yeah, that gives me more insight for sure.
Speaker 2 00:06:60
Damn, and I don't know how technically you want to be with this, but. One of the things that's new for me here also is not only do we have the product and state combination, but we also have environment conversations, you know, combinations as well. So if you get into AWS, I don't know, I don't know how technical you are. I mean, as far as like when you get in and work on things, but if you ever look at our AWS account stack, we have not only just, you know, the blue red environments, the dev environments, the testing QA, right?
Speaker 2 00:07:33
We have prod and all of that. We have those for each state, but also for each product. So ELT, for example, has like five, six, seven different environments in AWS accounts. Each one of those is still kind of new for me. They each get database versions deployed to them. So we're trying to consolidate this nebulous kind of combination style of deployment down to like one if we can. Or not one, but more shared theory, I guess.
Speaker 2 00:08:06
But yeah, I don't know what direction that would go.
Speaker 1 00:08:10
Yeah, in a past life, about 10 years ago, I built out our migration framework to go from those different environments. Because my old software was all on-premise, big SQL database. You'd configure giant workflows, and then you'd have to migrate them. So in my Likely apartment, I coded out a lot of that fun stuff.
Speaker 2 00:08:40
Fun? That's some fun stuff. So Microsoft Maybe? Because I was Microsoft Maybe for a few years.
Speaker 1 00:08:47
I was, yep. C Sharp and XAML.
Speaker 2 00:08:52
That's, yep.
Speaker 1 00:08:53
Before it was XAML. Well, I guess it was XAML. Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:08:57
So multidimensional expressions, anything like that. 
Speaker 1 00:08:60
Oh, I tried to stay away from a lot of that, yeah. MVVM, it was kind of our modeling software.
Speaker 2 00:09:09
There's one thing they did right, which was the whole DACPAC and database projects where you can actually deploy a current state. Again, golden standard kind of thing. But this, we use flyweight migrations for a lot of our back-end stuff, which is new as well.
Speaker 1 00:09:26
And we don't provide the administrators of these states the ability to configure or to modify any of it. That's really us, correct? Yes. Okay.
Speaker 2 00:09:36
Yeah, and you'll have to kind of get – sorry, everything is with caveat, of course. The way that this works also, which is new for me, is apparently states can also buy our – Our platforms after a certain, but I don't think they have the code base for it, like to be able to do what they will with it, but they do own it after. Sure. Or if you want to, I guess, I don't know how that works really, but that's, that's another thing that's outside of my, I'm going to share this real fast,
Speaker 2 00:10:06
but yeah. 
Speaker 1 00:10:07
probably relevant. Well, that was going to be kind of my next question is like, where would you recommend I look or videos I watch or if there's recordings, where do you recommend I learn more about current state, the gold standard, you know, where we're at today with all this stuff. 
Speaker 2 00:10:29
Man, I don't know. The IDLS stuff is probably the closest to what. They're wanting to get all of our products to, if that makes sense. So the UADM and what it represents, IDLS is the first product that we'll be using the UADM. The UADM should service everything in the future, from what I understand. VTAS, ELT, Clearinghouse, Cade, all that stuff, from what I understand, should be leveraging UADM in the future. But IDLS will be the first product that we're building from the ground up that's using this model.
Speaker 2 00:11:08
It's the first data model first approach as well. So it's the first time the developers have not had full rein creating their own DTOs and whatever they need to to make the application work. So I think it's a huge growing pain everywhere. But I think that anything that we're creating right now with IDLS should be what all the other... Thank you so much for being here.
Speaker 1 00:11:31
products need to be at um it's kind of what i'm i'm seeing just through my engagements here is like all signs point back to this idls so at least short term as like one of the the bigger priorities.
Speaker 2 00:11:47
so i'm gonna pull up real fast and i'm gonna see if this so we're doing so you've heard of vtaz before i'm sure we have a vtaz gen 2 um that is undergoing right it is also using the uadm as well it's the first iteration of vtaz i think it's only being deployed in rhode island but maybe uh right now using the uadm model as well but it's the first of our existing products to be switched over um i was going to see if i can get you they use plant uml um the architecture.
Speaker 2 00:12:23
architect architect guys and i'm trying to see if they have, Do you have Keybase stood up yet. 
Speaker 1 00:12:31
I do, but I don't think I have anything in it. I'm also not sure when to even use it.
Speaker 2 00:12:39
I don't get, so that's another thing. We need to work on security here. They use Keybase to securely transmit stuff. But in my last places, we had one password. We had like a company-wide one password vault. So we need to do something like that. Let's see. Tyler, come on. Are you in here? There you are. Okay. Sweet.
Speaker 1 00:13:05
So you're going to send me something through Keybase, and then I just have access to it. 
Speaker 2 00:13:09
You should see. I'm going to start just a quick CHAMP with you in here, if I can. I'm going to send you a link. Oh, yeah. This guy, and I'm going to send you – it requires a username and password, and this is another thing security-wise. We use – unfortunately, we use the same credentials for a lot of our systems, which I don't agree with, databases as well, but this guy is no exception.
Speaker 1 00:13:37
I'm in. I got it.
Speaker 2 00:13:39
Got it? Okay. So you should see a bunch of different – if you already logged in and everything, you see a bunch of different, like, links to designs in here. Yep. This is what Kevin's team, the enterprise architects – this is where a lot of their guidelines, I guess, or their documentation sits. So one in here is VTAS Gen 2 at the very top. Yep. That's the new version. I think the headless . 
Speaker 1 00:14:06
And the new version we'll be using – or the idea is the new version we'll be using the ODM.
Speaker 2 00:14:16
The UADM.
Speaker 1 00:14:17
UADM, yes.
Speaker 2 00:14:19
In the guidelines in the middle, we have acronyms everywhere. It stands for Unified Agency Data Model. It's under guidelines. It's just, that's the UADM itself. It's just a database concept, but all of the products that we have in here, eventually we would like to tie to that one core schema. VTAS will use like vehicle, it will use, you know, customers because people drive vehicles and ELT will have a lien part in there as well, eventually. But right now we're so focused on the IDLS part that we're creating everything that we need for driver's licenses in the UADM first.
Speaker 2 00:14:55
So this stuff is what Kevin's team has been working on. And it's everything that's unfortunately like in existence right now. And then what we're working on. And then what we're moving towards. There's no collected just one source of truth right now, like a directional, hey, this is what the plan is going forward, as far as I'm aware. At the very bottom, too, there's some other interesting things that you they're going to resurface pretty quickly, which is the global canonicalization data store.
Speaker 2 00:15:26
That's that's going to be a list of like vehicles, any possible vehicles that are legitimate instead of having people, you know, you know, open text fields in all of our products. We have the concept of a GLR or GER. If you've ever heard of that acronym, it's a global lender registry thing. Yep. We're we have global entities that we share amongst these different products. That's a place to look in here. But this is, I think, a good place to look at for an enterprise.
Speaker 2 00:15:57
I guess what Kevin, whenever he looks at some of this stuff, the way he sees it. So this might be a top down. Absolutely. This is a great, great resource. I apologize if you've already seen this before, especially if you were already logged in.
Speaker 1 00:16:09
That means you've probably seen this before, but I think Kevin sent me this and I didn't know I needed to look at it. Yeah, that's a good point.
Speaker 2 00:16:17
So it's good luck. I mean, I have a lot of questions about a lot of this stuff, maybe because I'm not a plan, you know, guru, but it does kind of give an idea of like what talks to what and why. Yeah, I usually have a lot of questions about this stuff. But yeah, this is kind of where I'd start just to kind of get an idea of what these things are. So sure. It took me forever. Like, I think my first month here was understanding like why HRS core was also DTMS.
Speaker 2 00:16:47
They all rolled up into VTAS and I didn't understand what was what.
Speaker 1 00:16:51
So do you know if that is VTAS Gen 2? Is that the goal of that version 2 is to be on the unified platform? Correct? Okay. So first off really is ID, IDS. is the first to be on the unified platform unified data model secondarily is then vtas gen 2.
Speaker 2 00:17:18
okay and once we i think kian right now is the one that's been focused uh heads down on vtas gen 2 his name is uh i don't know how to pronounce his last name he's the coolest guy ever but kian.
Speaker 1 00:17:29
um i have a meeting with him like this yeah he's super cool you're gonna love him.
Speaker 2 00:17:34
he's wonderful he's wonderful he's very smart he's brilliant um but he's the one that's been working on vtas i think it's been for rhode island rolling that one out first what i've been told is that for vtas rolling out in the future they're going to be using the uadm for any state doesn't matter who the ones that have vtas right now like west virginia new jersey maybe sure kentucky whoever else has this they will be around two whenever we can get to them they're going to be our outliers eventually like the more states we roll vtas into bring them in eventually.
Speaker 2 00:18:06
yep yep yes sir that's right yep, Um, so IDLS was our justification for the whole UADM thing and then everything else will eventually kind of tack onto it. And then the, uh, grandfathered in states are going to get an overhaul eventually. Sure. I understand. So I did not do a thumbs up yet. I'll give, I'll give one too. Yeah. But, um, yeah, that's, that's like a, I'm sorry. I kind of dove straight in there. It's just, this is just my, this is exactly what I was looking for. So I appreciate it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, the only other thing I was looking for. Oh yeah.
Speaker 1 00:18:41
Okay. I'm trying to, I'm like holding on. So you got this, you got this, you're calm and collected. Yeah. Um, is there a, I don't know if you work, if you know what you do works like this, is there like a JIRA or a confluence space where a lot of this is connected. 
Speaker 2 00:18:60
So I started, um, this is my fault and I take 100% of the responsibility and blame in this, but, um, we have. Several confluence spaces. I've got a data architecture one where I kind of had high hopes and dreams. I started a lot of stuff there. I'll send you that link. And Dan Kroll, who actually, I don't even think he's real, like really a person. I don't think he sleeps at all. He's just online and doing stuff constantly. He's just a real agent.
Speaker 1 00:19:26
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:19:28
He has a lot of data propelled documentation out there that I can link you to as well. Okay. We need to bring his stuff over into a data space. He has it kind of spread up underneath each of the platforms, however they had it designed at the time. But he has a lot of good information out there. But a lot of my stuff kind of fizzled out whenever IDLS started, which was a few months ago, several months ago.
Speaker 1 00:19:53
Yeah. But you are still tuned into the UDM. Is that correct. 
Speaker 2 00:19:59
100%. Oh, that is, that is 100% for better, for worse. But if there's anything as far as like details that you want, if there's, if you would like a, he has, if you go into his unified data, I like the way it breaks it out here. He does it manually in the, the, the architecture docs. If you go to the unified agency data model schema, he has each schema broken out like customer.
Speaker 2 00:20:33
This unfortunately, whenever he makes updates to this, it's manual. So whenever we push Git updates, yeah, it doesn't Git, so this is wildly out of date so far, even though it's really pretty. If you ever need an updated DLL, any kind of a schema or any kind of a map or anything like that, I can dump one out for you if you'd like. I can send you the Git repo if you would like to do it yourself as well. But this is also wildly out of date. We have hundreds more tables that are in here that kind of just show each of the different areas.
Speaker 2 00:21:04
But yeah, this is solely me, what I've been working on for the past four months. Sweet. Exclusively, which is exciting. I just wish I had more. I wish I didn't have more energy like Dan does to kind of give everything else.
Speaker 1 00:21:20
Yeah. But maybe I'll steal some of his energy for my learnings.
Speaker 2 00:21:27
So you though, you Git to work with Abby and you Git to work with, right? I mean, you Git to, oh my gosh, that woman has all the answers. So I know you will too.
Speaker 1 00:21:36
Oh yeah. They put me right next to her. So I'm trying my hardest not to ask her any and all questions that I have.
Speaker 2 00:21:43
Every time I like start to ping her, I'm like, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. But Lord, she is just, she has the, she is the cheese in my macaroni. I swear. She just, I Git the, this stuff on this end, but I'm like, okay, why does it need to be this way? And she just has.
Speaker 1 00:21:57
She knows exactly what's up. Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:21:59
Yes. The justification for the business as to why we need it that way. I'm like, okay, say no more.
Speaker 1 00:22:04
That's a goal of mine. My goal is to have that type of understanding. One, one day.
Speaker 2 00:22:08
I can already tell you're not shy at all. Like you come in, you're like, okay, what do I do? No nonsense. And it's pleasant. It's awesome. It's refreshing. And it's, that's what we need. So, um, but yeah, be patient with me if there's likewise. Yeah. I mean, you got this though. Um, if there's anything else that I can Git you, um, or if you want to just hop on for a few minutes, if there's anything in particular that I can maybe not help you with or help you with, um, just holler.
Speaker 1 00:22:37
Absolutely. Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:22:39
Are we at time, or do you have time more? Is there any other questions that you have. 
Speaker 1 00:22:44
You covered everything I was looking for, so I really appreciate your time. Yeah, nothing else really from my end.
Speaker 2 00:22:53
Okay. Is there anything technical? I mean, do you use DataGrip? I can give you a dump of the. 
Speaker 1 00:22:59
I don't yet. I'm in GitHub. I haven't programmed anything in the last five to seven years.
Speaker 2 00:23:11
Me too. Thank God. Yeah. I'm mostly… If anything, I just look in a database, ERDs, if you want.
Speaker 1 00:23:18
Just dump it in. Anything you want to send my way, I will take a look at for sure.
Speaker 2 00:23:24
Okay, I just didn't know, like, I'm usually, like, a visual person like this, I love ERDs to kind of make sense, but man, the Figma stuff, the Abby, marrying that with this makes everything make sense, so.
Speaker 1 00:23:36
Yeah, no, if you could send me whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate it.
Speaker 2 00:23:43
Okay, sorry, at certain points, I just kind of feel like I'm, like, blabbing on, so if there's anything, let's see. Oh, good. So UADM is, like, future, ODS is still out there, I don't know if you have any questions about that, or the EDW, or anything like that, yet, that's more for internal use. Eventually, we hope to make profits off of that, that's Beau's grand vision, of course.
Speaker 1 00:24:07
Sure, oh yeah, one step at a time, right. 
Speaker 2 00:24:12
Well, apparently one product or state at a time, whenever they, I still, you know, I'm just, I'm not shy about my feelings, I just. My last job, that's one thing that they did that I didn't like is that one client, it was like NetApp or something like that, that we had just that drove the palpitations, the heart palpitations of the business. Like right as soon as they were unhappy, everybody just dropped, you know.
Speaker 3 00:24:33
Sure.
Speaker 2 00:24:34
I'm eager to get into a place where it's like, OK, you know, Louisiana wants this. They're going to. All right, let's do this. And we, you know, prioritize it. But then we also level set to make it equal for everybody, you know. But this is great, though. This is it's been awesome so far and seeing how this works. So but I'm going to stop.
Speaker 1 00:24:56
No, it's all good. Where are you located at? I know I know when we were in person, you mentioned it. Where are you guys live at. 
Speaker 2 00:25:02
Little Rock, Arkansas. Arkansas. We are way downtown. Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:25:37
wrecks my day but um we went up there last week and i was like oh my gosh what's all this white stuff and then you know just a couple of days here we got a bunch of white stuff and. nobody's out like seriously everything's closed the roads are still not plowed nothing is is working so it's just funny to see how, You know, Cleveland does stuff and you guys are just like, this is funny.
Speaker 1 00:26:03
It was really coming down last night and I got my wife's car. I was like shoveling the driveway. So I was going to back her car up and then like repark it. I got it stuck in the front of our driveway. Oh, no. And so I told her, I was like, look, I'm going to work tomorrow. Do you need your car? And she said, no. So we're just going to let it melt. It's going to stay there until it melts.
Speaker 2 00:26:26
Seriously. I think it was Kyle that was bringing up stuff. Like everybody's brought up something from like, you have to worry about that there. Like you seriously. Kyle was telling me, he was telling me like some days that snows during the day so much that you have to shovel your way back in to your driveway when you get home. Did not realize that was a thing.
Speaker 1 00:26:42
Oh, I just let it rip. I just, I just send it.
Speaker 2 00:26:47
I'm mad. Like, oh my gosh, the guys that you guys had that plowed the actual streets. Yeah. I guess you guys can get stuck in, like if you're parallel parked on the – Oh, yeah. I had no idea that that was a thing. So it's just – I had no idea that some of the stuff that you guys had to deal with is just on a different level. You guys have different tires, apparently.
Speaker 1 00:27:09
I've never gone that far, yeah.
Speaker 2 00:27:11
Really? Yeah. You just wing it, see what happens. 
Speaker 1 00:27:14
Yeah, kind of play it by the seat of my pants there.
Speaker 2 00:27:20
We have – it's super cute here. So you guys are a big city, right? We get excited when we get to come up there because it's an actual city. I would call this a huge town. People bring out their little Jeeps and their dune buggies and everything. Like there's a squad that comes out here, and they patrol to see if there's anybody stuck. It's so cute. But, yeah, you guys are just on a different level. You guys are wild up there.
Speaker 1 00:27:43
Yeah, I would love to visit. This looks sweet. I've actually never – I've never looked at Little Rock before, if that.
Speaker 2 00:27:51
it's um it's a it is what it is yeah we like it here because you know you know obviously our family's here and everything we have we live in one of the two high-rise uh um residential buildings in the state okay i mean it's very um sprawling but it's older but i mean it's got a lot of nature stuff if you're into hiking if you're into lakes if you're like a lot of outdoorsy stuff yeah justin and i are both runners we like to jog and but i mean that's the extent of it um um so we're not we're kind of outcasts here in a lot of respects but um but it's fun it's a cute.
Speaker 2 00:28:25
area it's very pretty but wish we had a little bit more of uh all the seasons it's the way you guys get winters are the way we get summers it's usually like 95 okay 100 humidity like super hot like from march to november or december so we usually get like two months in there, Cold weather. A little slimmer, right? Yeah. But it's interesting being here. It's cool. But yeah, Cleveland is different. It's super crazy just because of the, you guys get severe weather as well and then snow.
Speaker 2 00:28:59
and wind. The wind that you guys get is just crazy.
Speaker 1 00:29:04
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I went to college out near Toledo, actually, but the wind there was killer because there was nothing to block the wind and you just had to get your lean on. Like, lean into it so it doesn't blow you away.
Speaker 2 00:29:18
Don't freeze.
Speaker 1 00:29:19
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:29:21
My God, it's just, it's foreign to me. I would never. Heads up, though, I haven't talked to Justin about it just yet, but I think I'm going to do maybe like a solo trip up there just to, he doesn't think I can travel by myself because he's always coming with me, but.
Speaker 1 00:29:37
Gotta prove him wrong, right. 
Speaker 2 00:29:40
But I just need some day time, right? I need some time to like, where we don't have like company-wide to do is, which is fun. It's great, but it just, I need to head down like stuff. So if I do get that scheduled, I'll let you know. Yeah, please do. Maybe I can come ruin your day.
Speaker 1 00:29:56
We'll huddle up in one of these, uh, these big meeting rooms here. We'll get a little battle station going.
Speaker 2 00:30:02
Did you see, did they show you like the secret door. 
Speaker 1 00:30:04
I thought they were lying to me. I heard, I haven't seen it open yet. I want to go, I'm about to go open it. So seriously. 
Speaker 2 00:30:10
seriously have Kyle or Kevin or somebody show you whoever's there. Um, if anybody's there, but I thought they were lying. So awesome. Well. 
Speaker 1 00:30:20

## Meeting Notes
### Unified Agency Data Model (UADM) Overview
- The meeting was initiated by Tyler to understand the status of the Universal Data Model (UADM).
- Speaker 2 is currently reporting to Kevin as a data architect. Their team, including Jake, Carrie, and Varsha, will now report to Britt.
- Speaker 2's original project was to improve the operational data store (ODS) for better real-time data and trust, but priorities shifted to IDLS for Louisiana.
- The UADM is a live version of the data warehouse, intended to be a single, shared database backend for all products to improve governance and stewardship.
### UADM Implementation and Product Rollout
- IDLS will be the first new product built from the ground up using the UADM—the company’s first “data model first” approach.
- VTAS Gen 2 is the first existing product being switched to the UADM, with an initial deployment in Rhode Island led by Kian.
- The long-term plan is for all products (e.g., VTAS, ELT, Clearinghouse, Cade) to leverage the UADM.
- States with existing VTAS versions (e.g., West Virginia, New Jersey, Kentucky) will be migrated to the new model in a later phase.
### UADM Architecture and State-Specific Configurations
- The UADM is designed to be the “golden standard” or core repository of terminology and logic.
- State-specific plug-ins will be aware of the UADM, but the UADM will not be aware of state-specific plug-ins.
- Mappings for state-specific verbiage will live within the state implementation but must map back to the core UADM.
- The company is working to consolidate numerous AWS environments (dev, QA, prod) that currently exist for each product–state combination.
### Resources and Next Steps for Learning
- Speaker 2 shared a link via Keybase to documentation managed by Kevin’s enterprise architecture team, which includes information on VTAS Gen 2 and the UADM.
- The documentation is built with PlantUML, but the schema information may be out of date.
- Tyler was advised that information on IDLS is a high priority and a good place to start learning.
- Speaker 2 offered to provide an updated DLL or a map of the UADM schema, as the version in the documentation is outdated.
- Other key concepts mentioned include the Global Canonicalization Data Store and the Global Lender Registry (GLR/GER).
## Next Arrangements
- [ ] Speaker 2 to send Tyler updated UADM schema information (DLL, map, or Git repo); include notes on versioning and current authoritative source.
- [ ] Tyler to review the enterprise architecture documentation shared via Keybase, starting with IDLS and VTAS Gen 2 sections.
- [ ] Tyler to connect with Kian regarding VTAS Gen 2 in Rhode Island and migration plans.
- [ ] Speaker 2 and Tyler to schedule a follow-up to address further questions and confirm the centralized source of truth for UADM artifacts.
## AI Suggestions
> **AI Suggestions**
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. The documentation for the UADM schema in the provided architecture link is “wildly out of date.” This presents a risk of stakeholders working with inaccurate information until an updated version is shared.
> 2. There is no single, centralized source of truth or clear directional plan documented for the UADM rollout. Information is fragmented across different Confluence spaces and individuals.
> 3. The company uses shared credentials for many systems, including databases, which was flagged as a significant security concern.
