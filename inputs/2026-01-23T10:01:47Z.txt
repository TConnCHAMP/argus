Speaker 1 00:00:03
My hope is that I can seamlessly cast to this TV.
Speaker 2 00:00:08
And hopefully it's not Bo's TV over there, right. 
Speaker 3 00:00:12
I heard that it's pretty hard.
Speaker 1 00:00:14
Yeah, like I can cast to this TV, but because we're going to be on a team meeting too, I'm like, is it going to mess up how I share my stuff. 
Speaker 3 00:00:28
I absolutely didn't remember. Tyler, I will take all notes for you.
Speaker 1 00:00:33
You can go get it if you want.
Speaker 2 00:00:36
Do I need it. 
Speaker 1 00:00:37
You don't need it, but if your disparity is set up, it might be better for you to walk through everything. At least the PTO, like how to put in your PTO information.
Speaker 2 00:00:46
That is important to me.
Speaker 1 00:00:49
But I have everything on the Welcome to Champ Confluence page as well, so you can always refer to that.
Speaker 3 00:00:58
I was like, I need to take notes, like, no, I just don't know if I, yeah, I'm glad to have an awkward buddy, yeah, the snow slowed down, yeah, the visibility, oh, yeah, like, the wind was just, I was excited that we are.
Speaker 1 00:02:02
Actually, Insperity just recently updated, so it looks like much nicer. Screenshots, like, they went from, the only way I can, like, think about it is they went from, like, an Android to an iPhone. Like, everything was square, and now everything is so round. So, let's get into tea.
Speaker 2 00:02:34
Yeah, the portal where I had to do all the initial, like, signing and stuff, that was pretty old and crusty.
Speaker 1 00:03:01
Hi Kara, can you hear me? Not feeling so well. No worries at all. I'm just trying to get to the TV here.
Speaker 2 00:03:30
Did they just update this. 
Speaker 3 00:03:31
Yeah, like a few days.
Speaker 2 00:03:32
Yeah, I don't like it. First paycheck, the products on the video was very informative. There was one from Q2. Oh. 
Speaker 4 00:04:00
I tried to get access to it, I posted it, and the design team caught up and saw it.
Speaker 1 00:04:23
Is there a camera in here, where should we look? Oh, there's not, it's just my...
Speaker 2 00:04:33
Oh, there's not.
Speaker 1 00:04:34
No, they have... Sorry, Kara. They have, like, these, you know, the devices that, like, follow everybody, but I have no post, to be honest. Yeah, and they're not... Yeah, so go ahead. So I'll kind of toggle back and forth between my presentation and Insperity to kind of show you what it looks like.
Speaker 1 00:05:09
So this is the agenda. We'll go through each of the tabs, and these tabs are going to be mainly under, you know, on the left-hand side under My Account. So the first tab is going to be your profile, and this one's actually going to be on the top. And this should be loaded in there for you, hopefully every UI, but when you click your name there, the first drop-down should be.
Speaker 1 00:05:46
This is where you see all of your personal information that you entered into your onboarding. So this is going to be your personal email, your phone, your home address. All of that information you can edit yourself using this edit button right here. And then in this middle column you'll see all of your work information. If for whatever reason you feel like there's any discrepancies with your department or your job title or supervisor, just let me know and I can always look into that and change that for you.
Speaker 1 00:06:19
We do have a lot of our teams are restructuring. So you'll see our org charts starting to come together here soon. On the very bottom of this page you'll see your emergency contact information. And that's also going to have the ability to be edited. So if that ever changes you can go ahead and change that. I do have an emergency contact page. that I'm actually going to be updating here soon, so make sure those are up to date.
Speaker 1 00:06:50
And that's going to be, like, a public page for the company, so everybody that has access to those will have access. Might I get a job title then. 
Speaker 3 00:07:03
Is it? Who gets the job title? No, if that changes, it's pretty easy. I mean, I don't know. I'm director of product management.
Speaker 1 00:07:20
Yeah, luckily, everything in Insperity is very editable, so if anything is, you know, if there's any discrepancy, you can always... So one of the most important tags for you is going to be your paycheck tag. It's going to be the first tag that's under my account. Once you get paid a few times, you'll start to see more information populate on this tab. It'll have like some diagrams that kind of show you where your money is going and give you some kind of stats on that. You'll see on every page and on this page specifically, you'll have the links on the right hand side.
Speaker 1 00:07:59
And this is going to be, you know, give you kind of like our unlimited PTO information, more W-2 wage and tax statement info, how to read your check stub. If you're interested in like a 529 college savings plan, under the paycheck details, you'll be able to see all of your pages and search each of your stubs and you can just download those very easy. Under that, you'll see all of your salary information, your pay frequency, your annual salary and your wage.
Speaker 1 00:08:39
Under that, you'll see all of the tax information that you initially put into the recording. So you'll see this View W-2 button, and I highly recommend if you'd like to receive your W-2 digitally, because that's how you go through and sign up. You can click there, and then also you can edit your W-2 collections as well, in case you want to add any dependents or remove them, or your filing status changes for whatever.
Speaker 1 00:09:11
reason. Under that, you'll see the state tax withholding that you can also edit, and on the very bottom, you'll have your direct deposit and e-pay stub info that you can also edit. So if you open a savings account, or you want a percentage of your check allocated to a different account, you can always just change that. Depending on when you change it in the pay cycle, it might actually... Under the Paycheck tab will be Benefits and you'll see in this tab, if you've already.
Speaker 1 00:09:51
enrolled in the benefits, you'll see everything that you elected. If you haven't enrolled, you'll have a deadline under the Enroll button. And obviously the Enroll button is how you start the enrollment process and it's pretty easy. It walks you through each of our plans and kind of gives you a rundown and then you can go ahead and select your plans. Under that, you'll see that we have Spending, which I'll get into for HSA.
Speaker 1 00:10:22
And then on the bottom of this screen, you'll see that we have a Benefits Specialist. And this is a good number to call if you have any specific benefits questions. I can give you an overview of what we had to offer, but I can't really tell you what to select or I can't really see the back end. I can see that you're elected into our benefits and what plan you're elected in, but I can't really see any additional information. So they have like all of the back end information that they can really assist you with.
Speaker 1 00:10:57
You'll see that there'll be a dependence button as well. And then there should be like a view plan comparison right here that will populate if you haven't enrolled in your benefits yet. But I do also, in comparison, should have included it in this invite. And I did in our previous email before you guys were onboarded, because for some reason, the plan comparison will go away for a long time. So I had it there for you.
Speaker 2 00:11:32
I had a question.
Speaker 1 00:11:33
Yeah, of course. Yeah, so let's see if I answer your question and then we can go ahead. So we have, there's two different kinds of savings accounts as to health care expenses. There's an FSA and an HSA. So the HSA is going to be the one that you're eligible for when you're enrolled in a high deductible plan.
Speaker 1 00:12:03
If you're enrolled in a choice plan, then you're eligible for the FSA with no HSA. The HSA is going to be the account that CHAM contributes to as well as your contributions. So CHAM is going to contribute $600 annually and that will get disbursed per pay for employees only and $1,200 if you have your dependents and family and that will also get the paycheck. So the nice thing with the HSA is that your money always rolls over, you don't have to worry about their being sent.
Speaker 1 00:12:38
With the FSA, CHAMP does not contribute to that account, and then you have a deadline that you have. The nice thing about the HSA as well is that it's a triple tax. So your contributions are going to be tax-free, your growth is tax-deferred. Once you have over $2,000 in your HSA account, you can actually invest that money, and then your withdrawals are tax-free from those expenses, and then that's the same with the FSA as well.
Speaker 1 00:13:11
So you can go to like a Walgreens or a CVS, and a lot of the items like over-the-counter you'll be able to purchase with this card. Was there any questions. 
Speaker 2 00:13:24
Yeah, I have an HSA now from her.
Speaker 1 00:13:27
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:13:28
Can I just start? can i click it up here or do i have to open this hsa yeah so um if your previous hsa is like still.
Speaker 1 00:13:42
active and you like what you're getting out of that you can go ahead and keep that if you'd like but um insperity does roll over everything pretty seamlessly so if you wanted to roll over and open your hsa here they could help you no not required by any means you don't have to be enrolled in the uh hsa at all um so you can be enrolled in either a pro choice or a high deductible plan and you don't have to be enrolled in the hsa or the fs um if you don't oh that was yeah so do i need to be.
Speaker 2 00:14:19
signed up with the health insurance to get the hsa yeah so in order to get the hsa you do need to be.
Speaker 1 00:14:25
signed up for the high deductible one of the high deductible health plans. And then we do just have shim for the dental. So this is going to be that same plan compared that I sent you. You'll see that these are all of the Choice Plus plans that I was talking about that are FSA eligible. There's your employee-only deductions, and then everyone else. These ones at the bottom are going to be the ones that are eligible.
Speaker 1 00:15:03
Yeah. I believe that it will come automatically. It should come 14. If not, though, you can always just contact me. They should be able to instruct you on how that comes. digital or physical card, but I know, like, I actually have one through my mom's job because she works at, and this is actually, like, a physical card that they give you that you.
Speaker 1 00:15:38
can just swipe. But I'll put it. Yeah, it is. It feels like it's not your money, but, you know.
Speaker 2 00:15:49
We use it for, like, at least the other one I have. Devices, too.
Speaker 1 00:15:55
Yeah, you can use it for a lot of wellness products. They do have, like, an FSA and an HSA store online, too, so you can order things and have them shipped to your house. You wouldn't believe how many things are actually, like, HSA and FSA eligible. Like, for instance, you know those LED face masks that they have for skin care? Those are actually HSA eligible. I definitely check it out. As a woman, I get, like, almost all of my woman products.
Speaker 1 00:16:26
from my HSA and FSA, so it's nice not to have to worry about, you know, paying taxes on them.
Speaker 3 00:16:36
I'm going to try to get, oh, yeah, I don't know about that. I think there was, oh, sometimes, like, you get a doctor's note. Oh, sweet.
Speaker 1 00:16:44
Yeah, the nice thing is, too, you'll see that we have a lot of, like, wellness fits through Insperity as well, so you couple that, HSA, wellness. So one of the most important tips, and this is also going to be on the inside under my account, and this is how you're going to be. So this is what you're, I have tasks here.
Speaker 1 00:17:24
You won't have tasks. should have like your paycheck 401k eventually will populate here so you won't even have to go into these eventually it's for you um so you can either go into time and attendance or from the home page um this is how i but i'll follow and it's okay yeah so you'll notice you'll notice.
Speaker 1 00:18:03
that there is yeah there's a time off balance but you can just disregard that this isn't really. it's my kind of attendance. Alright, so in general, you'll see that there will be something about PTO balance, like negative accruals, blah. You can just disregard all of that. That's like a user interface thing. You can't get rid of it if their clients do have their time. It will always allow you to remember. So again, just disregard it. For some reason, you'll see a lot of drop downs up here. You can disregard all of these. The first step is to just go to new requests and you'll see all of these.
Speaker 1 00:19:11
So new request, time over. Then your manager should automatically appear. You'll go to this plus sign with a date. So you'll click on the date that you're taking off. You'll see that it automatically goes to bereave pay for some reason. I don't know why that is. It's so annoying.
Speaker 1 00:19:43
But you have to drop down to pay time off. If you forget to do that for whatever reason, the pay is the same. So it won't affect anything. But if you catch yourself doing that, you can always cancel or resubmit. So you put this pay time off in this way. If you're taking a half day, you just put four here. If you're taking anything less than a half day, I wouldn't even worry about putting it into a spare day.
Speaker 3 00:20:10
I know, like a few hours.
Speaker 1 00:20:15
you have to log in. Yeah I think um honestly I just think that's a bit too extreme you know like a full day or a half day like a few a few hours I feel like going and logging into Insperity and putting all that in there. I think we'd much rather you put that in our team PTO calendar on Outlook which I'll also show you. Right then we have like that's how we would communicate. So then I just send it through. You can't do like a start date and an.
Speaker 1 00:20:52
end date for some reason they like make you add all the dates. Yeah so to take a week off you literally have to add each of the dates for I don't know why. Stopping you from taking a week off right? Like we're putting you to work do you really want to take all this time off? That's very anti-tuitive. Yeah, I think we saw.
Speaker 2 00:21:12
Abby didn't design that, I know that.
Speaker 1 00:21:14
Yeah, this is totally an all-insperity thing. So we don't have any of our internal team working on the UI. Yeah, so you would just add all of the dates here. You can see mine says negative 24, and I got a little notice up here. I don't know if you saw that when I submitted this here. I got a notice that said I had a negative accrual balance. Just click OK or dismiss it, and then submit your request.
Speaker 1 00:21:47
Like I said, the back-end settings won't work with pushing that. So our unlimited PTO plan is pretty much straightforward. It is just unlimited. We don't have any specific boundaries. time you have to take. It is like just kind of up to your discretion and your manager's discretion like you know don't take too too much time off and try not.
Speaker 1 00:22:19
to take too much time off during you know busy seasons and when people are really working on projects and heads are down you know. We haven't really had a.
Speaker 2 00:22:31
problem with this at all, the time off. They just don't pay you. Which I ran into at Highland, I was like what. 
Speaker 1 00:22:41
That makes sense. The second element to this is the team PTO calendar. So like if you had a doctor's appointment this is how I would put this in here. So basically how this works is you're going to make a new event. You're going to change the calendar from your calendar to team PTO. If you don't have the team PTO calendar you'll have to add, That's right.
Speaker 1 00:23:11
Yeah, you'll get the confirmation that you switched the calendar because you'll see everybody's really put your and follow the same naming convention that everyone else does and then just set your date. Do you do it all day? Yeah, typically people make theirs all day if they're going to be as like a doctor's appointment. The most important part of this is just always switching this calendar from your calendar.
Speaker 1 00:23:45
to the Team PTO calendar. We have had in the past some people like put Team PTO as a required person. And then obviously this just sends the email to the entire distribution link. Yeah, so if you need to, well basically you would notify your manager, that would likely be like a verbal conversation, and then however your team communicates that, I would definitely put it on the calendar, but I would say like your manager and your team are just the people that really, and that would be through verbal conversation, or you can send out a email.
Speaker 1 00:24:31
Or some people will even add like their manager, their team members as optional people on here, and then just keep the calendar as, so when they accept it doesn't, yeah, so one of, yeah, or required, one of the things that I'll do is I'll add myself, and then I'll,
Speaker 1 00:25:01
But typically, I will just like block off the team PTO calendar and then my own. But that's just a personal preference. Right, yeah. Okay, so just a little bit. All right, the 401k, I'll briefly go over this because you guys aren't eligible for this yet.
Speaker 1 00:25:35
So I think it's probably better if we go over more in depth. But the 401k tab will populate for you after 60 days. You can start viewing your options. After 90 days, you'll actually be eligible to enroll. Of course, CHAMP matches dollar to dollar up to 4%, and that's immediately vested, which is awesome. Another thing, too, you have to roll over a 401k. a previous company, Insperity can help you with that. It's a pretty seamless process. The nice.
Speaker 1 00:26:08
thing is when you enroll in our 401k through Insperity, it is going to be a very like interactive. So it's not just like here are your options and then you select them. They like have the plans. They even have like a calculator you can put in your income and financial information. So we have the pre-tax and then we have the marketplace that work. This is going to be.
Speaker 1 00:26:45
the very last tab on that left hand side and this is what it's going to look like once you, and I don't know if you guys have ever had a different company. My mom, Well, basically there's two sides of this. You get discounts and then also they have a rewards program where you accumulate. So for being an employee, you'll notice that on your checks, you get discounts on all of these items here. So health, you can see they have like mental health, physical health, flowers, tickets, auto, electronics, food.
Speaker 1 00:27:38
And then they even have like exclusives for as well. Good rates with AT&T in the auto 13% save up to 13% on like internet with that version. I did simulate like booking travel through here one day and I could have saved like a hundred and fifty bucks.
Speaker 1 00:28:11
So it's one of those things that you're gonna purchase these things already, Especially like homes and things like that. I'm gonna check out to see if you can get a discount here, Then once you purchase anything through here There's what's called wow points, Wow points never expire and there's no blackout dates and then you basically exchange those wow points for. exemption center Once I accumulate wow points I can go here.
Speaker 1 00:28:42
So one of like an example that I have for this is someone told me that they have like an issue with ordering DoorDash food all the time, So what they're gonna do is buy like the DoorDash gift cards that work, they won't get a discount on the gift card but they will get the wow points for the gift card and then they can just use the wow points to get more or whatever so you know it's one of those things that you might as well yeah you might as well try to save a buck i mean yeah for sure so.
Speaker 1 00:29:19
definitely would check this out you just have to sign up and make it every single time the markets it will just automatically then they also have like a really good deal with things, on there so i'll share this canva with you guys and you can watch this um video on the comfort.
Speaker 1 00:29:50
employee um they do also have a youtube channel so every single time they come out with new discounts, they kind of go over like how to best save on all of their new discounts and just like cool things that they've added so if you're a coupon clipper and one of those people that's like really invested in saving money you can go ahead and check out and then um the org so this is going to be under.
Speaker 1 00:30:20
the employee directory or company yeah so this is the only like all employees org chart that we have, our executives have like an interrupt that they've been utilizing and kind of recreating a lot of our teams and moving things around.
Speaker 1 00:30:54
an org chart in slack or confluence or anything like that so our only org chart for employees is going to employee director um what it's going to show when you go into here is you and your manager to get to the very top of the org chart you can look up anybody and see like like their department um so um to familiarize yourself with our teams i know recently our slack channel that.
Speaker 1 00:31:35
someone posted this the recent seating chart that we have, A lot of our teams actually completely moved around the office, like even in the last few weeks. Yeah, so like a couple weeks ago, I actually walked into the office and they had changed like where a few departments sit in on Friday. They just like rearranged everything. So if you're not new, it's still new to us all where everybody's sitting. So this is a good way to familiarize yourself with teams and then also use the seating chart to see where everybody's actually physically located in the office.
Speaker 1 00:32:11
You can see under Shane, we have each of our teams. So we have LT that's going to be head of strategic relationships, and you're going to have like government. Libby Malhouse, Quinn, Jeff Shushart. Quinn and Jeff are remote, but they actually...
Speaker 2 00:32:32
She's presenting us.
Speaker 1 00:32:33
Yeah, they're in the showroom now. Which is the room beyond Charleston over there. Bo Shim is the CTO, and he sits actually right in this office to us next to Batten. You can kind of see his here. You'll see Abby Birmingham. She sits out in that main area. And we have a lot of our teams sit very close to each other, too, so these guys will all be there.
Speaker 1 00:33:06
But I like to use this tool to get familiarized with names, titles, connected to who. If you have questions about certain products or just certain things, you can all kind of see, like, what team should I go to to ask? And then also, everybody should have their name on.
Speaker 1 00:33:43
Um, yeah, we could, I think there was a deadline, but I missed one. I think if you miss the deadline, you get Ohio. So, um.
Speaker 2 00:33:54
It's the worst state in the world.
Speaker 1 00:33:56
No, it's not. Alrighty, so the last thing I'll go over will be the chat box. And this will be on the bottom right-hand corner. This is a great way to get benefits in 401k. So, I've kind of put the steps here. So, you'll click on the icon here. Go to Let Us Help. They'll be open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern Time or 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Central.
Speaker 1 00:34:32
You'll click Chat Now. Once you go to Chat Now, it will open up the chat box feature. Alright, so it'll automatically have your client number, your email, and then there'll be two topics. Benefits, then they'll have a subtopic as well, so it gets even more specific. If you have, like, questions about the HSA, like this one would be a good one for you to use about your previous HSA and how to.
Speaker 1 00:35:07
And then ID cards is a really good one to use if you are going to the doctor before you get your physical card in the mail. That should take about two weeks business, 14 business days to receive that physical card in the mail, but if you need it sooner, you can go into this and then they should be able to provide you with your member ID info through United. You can get logged in through there and then see like your digital card and then just print out that digital card. With your health benefits, you are going to be covered retroactive to your hire date.
Speaker 1 00:35:41
So you'll have the deadline to enroll in your benefits, but even if you wait until the day before the deadline, you're still covered from your hire date. So if you went to the doctor any time between then, you'll get reimbursed out of pocket if you paid out of pocket. So yeah, that is basically all of the tabs that we touched in.
Speaker 1 00:36:15
Yeah, so open enrollment just recently passed. Last year, it was in December. This year, it was like mid-December, early January. So the dates kind of always fall on time, but typically it's going to be December.
Speaker 2 00:36:39
Reimbursement or pre-tax, that is like a tax thing. 
Speaker 1 00:36:47
Yeah, so all the parking is actually very new. From what I, when I first started, and from what I know of, we didn't have parking covered at all. I think what you're talking about is our commuter benefits. Yeah, so we have commuter benefits through Insperity, and basically that's you putting your own money, pre-tax dollars, into a commuter account, and you can use that account to pay for parking.
Speaker 1 00:37:18
And also, like, RTA passes if you take the bus or the subway. Anything like that, you can use that for. So, CHAMP does not cover parking. We have, there's a few parking lots out here that have, like, monthly passes and day passes. Around the office, I believe $10 for a day, and then a monthly pass is $75. So, you could use your commuter benefits and that pass. And basically, yeah, so that's going to be under your benefits tab right here on the side, commuter benefits.
Speaker 1 00:37:54
um so this is where it will explain everything to you um and then how to get started on that so i believe you have to call this yeah everything is in central time but yeah it'll have all the information on here for you how to get started yeah.
Speaker 1 00:38:28
um i'm not sure i think that you can use it for any parking because it's like um it's your own.
Speaker 2 00:38:34
benefit it does say at or near your place of work but depending on i don't know what.
Speaker 3 00:38:40
necessarily means like how close to that's forgiveness a while from here but the thing is that that's how it's like i need to be a lot. Just pre-tax, yeah, exactly. All right, Kara, did you have any questions? All right.
Speaker 3 00:39:11
Because I saw, like, a call. Yeah. Like, random things like that that are not there. Because I saw, like, that store, but there's, like, all this stuff. I'm going to find it again, though.
Speaker 1 00:39:27
Yeah, it should be under your benefit. Oh, it is, okay. Yeah, on the right-hand side, it should be, like, well, your... Yeah, so it's all going to be... I need other ones. Really, all of our benefits. other than the Harvest Owl. So the Harvest Owl is the only thing that we have in the office that's.
Speaker 1 00:40:01
not going to be managed. And Spirity manages our 401k and they have that health care program.
Speaker 2 00:40:17
I did two on Monday and two on Friday so that I can fit all. And I think it came out to like 40 bucks. But yeah, I had a little sandwich. The Harvest Owls are really fun. No, the sandwich and chips. Oh yeah, they're giving me soup next week so I'll report back on that one.
Speaker 2 00:40:48
I will sign up for next week. Yeah, that meatball thing.
Speaker 1 00:40:54
I shared the benefits at glance, so this is going to be all of the benefits that you have to your disposal as an Insperity and CHAMP employee, so you'll see the column.
Speaker 2 00:41:07
And I think I saw that you guys have some sort of visual into other sessions.
Speaker 1 00:41:20
No, we don't have any visuals into our stands. Like I said, I can see that you're in little information there.
Speaker 3 00:41:54
I had no idea how strong we were. Well, if you don't use it, you can't do better. I did not know that. We couldn't do that without you. Alright, Kara, I'm gonna end this right now for you. Just because we're old. I hope you feel better. Thank you so much.
Speaker 2 00:42:16
I need to say it was great for, um...

## 1. Insperity Portal UI Update and Access
### Conclusion
Insperity recently updated its UI, making it nicer and more modern, though some attendees find aspects unintuitive; the team will continue using the updated portal for onboarding and HR functions.
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: The Insperity portal UI was recently updated and is more modern and rounded compared to the previous square design.
   - “Went from Android to iPhone” metaphor
   - Update occurred recently; screenshots look nicer
2. [Tyler]: The previous portal used for initial signing felt old and crusty; the new UI change is not preferred.
   - Expressed dislike for the recent change
3. [Speaker 3]: The update happened a few days ago, confirming recency.
## 2. Profile and Work Information Management
### Conclusion
Employees can self-edit personal and emergency contact details; discrepancies in work info (department/job title/supervisor) should be reported to [Speaker 1] for correction. An emergency contact page will be updated soon.
### Plan
- [ ] Update and publish the company emergency contact page and ensure employees’ entries are current -- [Speaker 1]
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Employees can edit personal info and emergency contacts in Insperity; work info discrepancies should be sent to [Speaker 1] for adjustment.
   - Personal email, phone, home address editable via “Edit”
   - Emergency contact section editable; public page to be updated
2. [Speaker 3]: Job title clarity is needed; stated “director of product management.”
   - Asked who sets job titles
3. [Speaker 1]: Insperity data is highly editable, facilitating quick corrections.
## 3. Paycheck, Tax, Direct Deposit, and W-2 Preferences
### Conclusion
Use the Paycheck tab to view pay details, taxes, direct deposit, and e-pay stubs; opt in for digital W-2s and update withholding and dependents as needed.
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Employees should enroll for digital W-2s and can edit withholding, dependents, and direct deposit allocations.
   - View W-2 button for digital delivery
   - State tax withholding editable
   - Direct deposit/e-pay stub info configurable, including multiple accounts
2. [Tyler]: First paycheck topic mentioned; prior product video was informative (Q2).
   - General interest in paycheck transparency
## 4. Health Benefits Enrollment, HSA vs FSA, and ID Cards
### Conclusion
Eligibility: HSA requires enrollment in a high-deductible health plan; FSA pairs with Choice plans. CHAMP contributes $600 annually for employee-only HSA and $1,200 for dependents/family. Physical ID cards typically arrive in 14 business days; digital cards can be obtained sooner via chat support.
### Plan
- [ ] Use Insperity chat to retrieve digital ID card details if care is needed before physical card arrival -- Tyler
- [ ] Confirm HSA rollover options or maintain existing HSA as preferred; Insperity can assist with transfers -- Tyler
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: HSA eligibility requires enrollment in high-deductible plans; FSA is for Choice plans; CHAMP contributes to HSA, not FSA.
   - CHAMP contributes $600 (employee-only) or $1,200 (dependents/family) annually, disbursed per paycheck
   - HSA is triple tax-advantaged; investment allowed over $2,000 balance
   - FSA has deadlines and does not roll over; CHAMP does not contribute
2. [Tyler]: Has an existing HSA and asks about linking and insurance requirements.
   - Asked if health plan enrollment is required for HSA (yes: high-deductible)
   - Asked about using existing HSA vs opening a new one
3. [Speaker 1]: Insperity can roll over HSA funds seamlessly; enrollment in HSA/FSA is optional; physical ID cards typically in 14 business days; digital ID obtainable via chat.
   - Benefits specialist contact available for specific plan questions
   - Dental is via “shim” (context indicates a simple/standard plan)
4. [Speaker 3]: Over-the-counter purchases and wellness products can often be HSA/FSA-eligible, sometimes needing a doctor’s note.
## 5. Unlimited PTO Policy and Request Process
### Conclusion
PTO is unlimited and discretionary with manager oversight; employees should submit full-day or half-day requests in Insperity and use the Team PTO Outlook calendar for shorter absences. Ignore negative accrual balances and UI warnings when submitting PTO.
### Plan
- [ ] Follow the process: submit PTO in Insperity for full or half-days and block time in Team PTO calendar for partial absences; notify your manager verbally or via email when appropriate -- Tyler, Kara, [Speaker 3]
- [ ] Add managers and team members as optional attendees for visibility when appropriate; avoid adding Team PTO as a required attendee to prevent mass emails -- Team members
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Unlimited PTO is manager- and team-discretion-based; avoid heavy PTO during busy seasons.
   - UI shows PTO balance/negative accruals—disregard
   - New Request defaults to “bereave pay”; switch to “paid time off”
   - Must add each date individually for multi-day requests (unintuitive)
2. [Tyler]: Acknowledged that PTO is straightforward and contrasted with prior employer practices.
   - Mentioned prior issue with unpaid time off at Highland
3. [Speaker 1]: For absences less than half-day, prefer using Team PTO Outlook calendar rather than logging hours in Insperity.
   - Switch calendar from personal to Team PTO
   - Avoid adding “Team PTO” as a required attendee to prevent mass emails
   - Notify manager verbally or via email; optional attendees can be added
4. [Speaker 3]: Raised usability concerns about logging a few hours; agrees calendar use is simpler.
## 6. 401(k) Eligibility, Matching, and Enrollment Timeline
### Conclusion
The 401(k) tab appears after 60 days; enrollment eligibility starts at 90 days. CHAMP matches dollar-for-dollar up to 4%, immediately vested. Insperity assists with rollovers; the enrollment experience includes calculators and plan guidance.
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Outlined timeline and matching details; emphasized immediate vesting and available support.
   - 60 days to view options; 90 days to enroll
   - Dollar-to-dollar match up to 4%; immediate vesting
   - Rollover assistance available
2. [Tyler]: Not yet eligible; will revisit later.
## 7. Insperity Marketplace Discounts and Wow Points
### Conclusion
Employees can access discounts across categories and earn wow points that never expire; points can be redeemed for savings. It is recommended to check the marketplace before routine purchases.
### Plan
- [ ] Sign up for Insperity Marketplace; monitor YouTube channel updates for new discounts -- Tyler, Kara, [Speaker 3]
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Marketplace offers discounts on health, tickets, auto, electronics, food, etc., with exclusive rates (e.g., AT&T; save up to 13% on internet with Verizon).
   - Simulated travel booking yielded ~$150 savings
   - Wow points accrue and can be redeemed; never expire; no blackout dates
2. [Speaker 1]: Suggested strategy: buy gift cards (e.g., DoorDash) to earn wow points, then redeem for further savings.
## 8. Org Chart, Teams, Seating, and Directory Familiarization
### Conclusion
Employees should use the Insperity employee directory to navigate org structures since there’s no org chart in Slack/Confluence; seating has been rearranged recently, and the Slack-posted seating chart helps locate teams.
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: The only comprehensive org chart for employees is in the directory; executives are actively restructuring teams.
   - Slack recently posted a new seating chart; departments moved seats in recent weeks
   - Examples of leaders and locations: Bo Shim (CTO) sits near the meeting room; Abby Birmingham in main area; Quinn and Jeff are remote but currently in showroom
2. [Tyler]: Acknowledged presentation and locations.
## 9. Benefits Enrollment Windows and Coverage Timing
### Conclusion
Open enrollment typically occurs in December; coverage for health benefits is retroactive to hire date even if enrolled later within the window, with out-of-pocket reimbursements available.
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Recent open enrollment spanned mid-December to early January; timing varies but generally December.
   - Retroactive coverage to hire date; reimburse out-of-pocket if care occurs before enrollment
2. [Tyler]: Asked about reimbursement vs pre-tax implications.
## 10. Commuter Benefits and Parking
### Conclusion
CHAMP does not cover parking costs; employees can use pre-tax commuter benefits via Insperity to pay for parking and transit (RTA). Typical costs near the office: $10/day or $75/month.
### Plan
- [ ] Set up commuter benefits via Insperity benefits tab; contact support to initiate (central time support hours) -- Tyler
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Commuter benefits allow pre-tax contributions for parking and transit; setup details are on the benefits tab and may require a call.
   - Parking near office: $10/day; $75/month
2. [Tyler]: Policy mentions “at or near your place of work”; seeks clarity on how close.
   - Concern about eligibility distance interpretation
3. [Speaker 3]: Noted ambiguity and personal need; emphasized pre-tax savings value despite rules uncertainty.
## 11. Harvest Owl Office Meals and Other Perks
### Conclusion
Harvest Owl is an in-office perk not managed by Insperity; employees are using and evaluating offerings.
### Discussion Points
1. [Tyler]: Tried meals (two on Monday and two on Friday) totaling about $40; positive feedback and plans to try soup next week.
   - “Meatball thing” mentioned
2. [Speaker 1]: Most other benefits are managed through Insperity; Harvest Owl is the exception.
## 12. Meeting Logistics: Casting to TV and Cameras
### Conclusion
Casting to the TV may interfere with concurrent Teams meeting screen sharing; there is no room camera; presenter will toggle between slides and Insperity.
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 1]: Concern about screen-share conflicts when casting during a Teams meeting; no tracking camera in room.
   - Will toggle between presentation and live Insperity demo
2. [Tyler]: Confirmed lack of camera; discussed TV ownership (not Bo’s TV).
> AI Suggestions
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. Clarify commuter benefits “at or near your place of work” definition and eligible parking locations. Employees expressed uncertainty about how close parking must be to qualify; provide a policy reference or Insperity-confirmed guidance and examples.
> 2. Formalize the process for partial-day absences (less than half day). The current guidance prefers Outlook Team PTO calendar over Insperity logging, but no explicit standard is set on manager notification and calendar invite conventions; define steps and expectations.
> 3. Confirm timeline and steps for the emergency contact public page update. The page is going to be updated soon, but no date or owner beyond [Speaker 1] was set; establish a deadline and communication plan to ensure employees verify their information.
> 4. Provide a concise guide for PTO request submission addressing known UI friction points. Employees must add each date individually and the default type shows “bereave pay”; create a quick checklist to reduce errors and frustration.
> 5. Document the HSA rollover procedure and ID card access steps. While Insperity can assist, employees need a clear walkthrough (who to contact, forms needed, typical timelines, digital card retrieval) to avoid delays in care and contributions.
