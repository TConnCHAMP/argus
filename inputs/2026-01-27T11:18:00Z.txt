Speaker 1 00:00:22
How are you? Good. Yes.
Speaker 2 00:00:24
You all right? Yeah, you all right. 
Speaker 1 00:00:33
Yeah.
Speaker 1 00:01:05
Yeah, yeah, sit here.
Speaker 2 00:01:08
Sweet, yeah, I appreciate your time. Sure. I just wanted to get together and chat and see how else I can stay connected in, so. That's a good question. Yeah, I know, we talked, it's part of the interview and all.
Speaker 3 00:01:26
Yeah, I mean, a lot of it's going to be part, like, just through these meetings, like, are you in the violations meeting today? Yeah. So I think it's going to be just kind of going to come naturally out of a lot of those meetings.
Speaker 2 00:01:38
So I was talking with Carrie a little bit yesterday, and my understanding, and correct me if my understanding here, it seems like the architecture group itself isn't necessarily, and I could be, it doesn't have, like, a sole focus or, like, decision-making, but almost gets loaned out to these projects or these states. And that's where those decision-making things are going.
Speaker 3 00:02:07
Yeah, I mean, it's, so there's two ways. There's what we'd like to be able to do. Sure. And then what we can't do. And lately, with all the work, it's basically, it's okay, just, you know, I'll handle these two projects. Justin, you handle these projects. Kian, you got these projects. Kerry, you got everything data. And it's like, you know, we used to do more with the reference architecture and get ahead of things,
Speaker 3 00:02:40
try to keep our heads above water.
Speaker 2 00:02:41
I get that. There's definitely a lot going on. What was I looking at? I've been looking at the UDM. UDM, yeah. Is the page that you sent me up to date. 
Speaker 3 00:03:03
It's, it's... Definitely not up to date how far out of date. I think the last time I updated it. Okay Is that something that you typically it's just when I get a chance I go on it So what we do if you look at the actually doing github repo, okay? It generates plain uml diagram a PR diagram Yeah, and but it but it just generates it as one big giant diagram, So what I do then is I take it and break it out into those schemas and create out the separate.
Speaker 3 00:03:38
We'll create it into that that design document so that be the source of truth. Yeah Yeah, that is that is then is there just one. Yeah, pretty good. Yeah, and you can I mean you could like if you wanted to see where you wanted to use different database Tools you could bring up that database locally, It's all Flyway scripts, so you just run the Flyway scripts, and create a database,
Speaker 3 00:04:09
do all the, create all the schemas, everything, store procedures, everything. So everything's done through Flyway.
Speaker 2 00:04:16
My next is a big vibe code on this. Necessarily, I haven't written a line of code in years. I can explain what I want.
Speaker 3 00:04:30
But yeah, it's pretty easy to run, you know, to run Flyway. You just, there's a, you can download the jar, and then you have to add Java, and you point it at the directory where all the scripts are, and add it at a local database. There's probably, I don't even know if there's a, there's a, there might be a Docker Compose file in there that'll do all the, well, anyways.
Speaker 3 00:05:05
yeah i've been um yeah there is there's a doctor composed so you can just bring down the uadm project bring that up and i'm guessing it brings up the database and the phones fly away yeah it.
Speaker 2 00:05:15
doesn't um i've been working i don't want to say i'm focused on closer to the fees engine how are you getting the fees engine is being built out for louise but we want to make sure that it can, is there a architect is the uadm engine yeah the fees engine i have not i mean.
Speaker 3 00:05:53
ian's been doing most of that i saw that yeah and i have i've only been kind of reviewing what he's done i haven't had any time to create an ad okay.
Speaker 2 00:06:05
He had a lot of database papers and process flows and all that, so that's where I was kind of like trying to... He was presenting it, and I didn't know how involved you were in the team.
Speaker 3 00:06:14
Yeah, so he's pretty much all of that stuff he's reviewed with me.
Speaker 2 00:06:17
Okay.
Speaker 3 00:06:18
And after the fact, but that's why I'm here.
Speaker 2 00:06:23
The only thing that I didn't see on there, like identifier, and not to get too, like, it looked like there was just the state SKU table, and then just all the SKUs. There was, like, no way to say, like, this SKU is specific.
Speaker 3 00:06:42
Well, I think, so I can't remember, to be honest, but the one I'm trying to remember, I think that these tables, because I'm guessing the fees engine will get, we've got this whole idea of, you know... Global versus state deployed sure so I'm thinking this might be state deployed So you wouldn't have to so you would just populate that every state would have their own instance of the engine.
Speaker 2 00:07:15
And would only be populated with their skills with their skills. Why would globally well. 
Speaker 3 00:07:26
I don't know yeah, and I like which are kind of our default position has always been that we For any any of the state based systems that they are you know deployed independently and all for the point There is that states don't want their data mixed with other state, so I think that kind of default to that. Yeah, that makes sense why there was no idea, but to be honest. I'm not positive.
Speaker 2 00:08:03
I started to write up some of my thoughts, just as I was looking at it, just in terms of normalization. Not to get into specifics, but if you're tuned into that, then I plan on being involved.
Speaker 3 00:08:27
Yeah, and you can pull me into that, too, if you want to have all three of us there.
Speaker 2 00:08:31
Okay, cool. Yeah, because I'd love your take. Is this how we want it structured? Is this how it should be structured? I've almost found that there's two, I won't say broad, but with scale, right? So the storage, then there's the, it's all hard code.
Speaker 2 00:09:02
What do you mean? So I'll use the fees engine, just because that's the only example I have. Like, how do you calculate the calculation for the final, which SKU to put, is like this giant flow. I assume that goes into some type of method or something. That's like hard-coded Louisiana, here's how you calculate the SKU.
Speaker 3 00:09:30
I would think so. So generally, have you gotten familiar with the plugins? No. Well, I understand the concept that there are plugins. So, I mean, because we've had this discussion, so just so you know, and I, because I've had this discussion, every new person comes in and sees this and they, we had a discussion, three years ago, you know, that led to this, to how we got here. One of the things is because we, you know, we've got separate instances running for each.
Speaker 3 00:10:02
one. We made the decision at that time that the only way we can scale is if we can deploy the same core set of code to all these states and then just have these plug-ins. But we have to keep that version on the same version for everybody, the core version. So when we do an upgrade, and this is kind of based on, I don't know if you ever worked with Salesforce at all. Yeah, just on the front end. Every six months, they upgrade their platform, and you have to upgrade.
Speaker 3 00:10:35
You can't be on an old version. There is no leeway. It's like, no, we upgrade. They let you know three months ahead, here's the changes coming, start testing. This date, we're going with the new version, and any modifications you've made, if they don't work, well, they don't work. So this was kind of the model because we said we can't have 15 versions. Sure. Oh, yeah. One for each thing. Finally. That'll never scale. We were so out of sync with that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we just, we'd have to hire so many people. And so that's how we, how, that was the, like, you know, what we started with. That was the main requirement we started with, that we can't do that. Maybe we revisit that and we, people want to consider everything in, but that's what we started with. So that's how we ended up. So then it's like, okay, now how do we modify?
Speaker 3 00:11:25
When we first tried to do stuff in the, you know, put a bunch of stuff in the database, we realized the rules were way too complex to just use, like, values. You would end up having to put some kind of, basically create a language that could then be stored in the database and run dynamically. And our take on that was, well, we've got Java programmers. Why would we create a new language? Let's just let them write in Java. And that was where the plug-in came in.
Speaker 3 00:11:57
So you create your, you know, we have an API that says these are the things the plug-in can do. And then any custom logic goes in there. So, yes, it's hard-coded, but it's like, okay, but we can deploy quickly if we want to. I mean, we have everything in place that it's a matter of, you know, checking the code, run the test. Yeah. So it's like, it doesn't save you anything. Like, we're never going to let users update something while the system's running.
Speaker 3 00:12:31
Right. It's always going to come from us. So it's like putting it in the database doesn't really buy you anything, I think.
Speaker 2 00:12:39
Yeah, I'm almost thinking, too, my mind went to seeing some of these calls with AMVA and, like, even what Abby's created. Logical flow come from the discovery sessions. It almost seems like that's where the that's where some type of Not Java and I'm not gonna some type of not job whether it's point-and-click or highly configurable would work would help Internally us then you're not relying on Java devs.
Speaker 2 00:13:11
You can have someone who isn't in dev point and click this logic out possibly.
Speaker 3 00:13:20
That's just where my yeah, It's like I get that but it's like I just wonder how far you can go with that. Mm-hmm, you know.
Speaker 2 00:13:32
There is some type of hey, there's an outlier, Update our let's update this not Java. Yeah, that's just initially where my mind was because it seems like the, UADM is gonna solve the storage the scalability of the story. I'm also seeing that bigger one.
Speaker 3 00:13:55
Yeah, I think it would be interesting to run that out, like step through it on a whiteboard and see what... Because that's going to add... Either you keep that clickable, being able to redo logic. Depending on what you use, it's either got to be so simple that a non-programmer would use it, and then if it's that simple, is it powerful enough to do what we actually need?
Speaker 3 00:14:28
Sure. And that's the trade-off there.
Speaker 2 00:14:30
Well, and the thing that I've been kind of playing around with, too, it's a BPMN model, a modeler, but I've been playing around with this sub-program. So maybe there is for the NSV. We could drop in the basic fee-type extraction.
Speaker 3 00:14:47
So we used Comunda here. okay and did not have real in turn in what sense it one we ended up having to have our programmers to maintain the models anyway and it was much then then we ended up having performance issues opposed to just writing the job which is again you know all of these things that people you know I'm not this is not a.
Speaker 3 00:15:19
criticism or anything everybody comes here does this yeah and he's like yeah we did that three years ago sure and that's how we ended up where we are because we tried these things like we had the same thoughts you're like yeah we should do this way we should use Camunda okay great and not so great maybe that didn't work out so long so I mean I'm always open to trying stuff again and yeah maybe do take it I'm working on a little concept that I once.
Speaker 2 00:15:47
I'm comfortable I'm trying to get some of the fees engine, translated just to kind of like showcase it yeah if anything i'm i'm using it to learn yeah no.
Speaker 3 00:16:02
that's fair um the only thing just and i don't know if you if Camunda was one of the ones you're looking at one of the reasons that we stopped using it too though was because they changed.
Speaker 2 00:16:10
their license yeah i'm using an open source um okay is that one based on flowable global, they all seem like they use the same modeler yeah because Camunda was open source and then they.
Speaker 3 00:16:28
changed on the next version so you were stuck no thanks so that was why we did that was part of the reason that was the other reason but we never it just never there were a couple problems one, nobody here when we it kind of got introduced but without much guidance and so there wasn't, people didn't have a good play later it's like okay do we do all of it and so those people try to tackle a little part of it and it just it just never fit in while there that we did try to do with clearing house that was kind of.
Speaker 3 00:17:01
more all Camunda and it was okay but again if we ended up having it got to be so complex that our programmers had to do all of it anyway sure okay well if.
Speaker 2 00:17:11
you're doing that just you already know Java just write it Java yeah I love to get object-free speeding that up because right now that seems and of course there is going to be trying to understand yeah yeah just in terms of what I'm kind of.
Speaker 3 00:17:42
looking at okay yeah again you know I'm open to anything I I don't you don't.
Speaker 2 00:17:48
throw a UI on the UADM.
Speaker 3 00:17:50
Yeah, I don't, yeah, I personally, whatever is the best thing that works is what I'm for.
Speaker 2 00:17:57
Yeah. Well, I'm also interested, I talked to Ian, too, about it maybe in our chat, like, I don't want to control the price, the SKUs. I'm not saying we give that explicitly to the states themselves, but someone, whether, maybe that's someone in turnally here who takes the call, saying, hey, we're changing the SKU. I think that might be a good time to play around with some of that, like, intermediary stuff.
Speaker 3 00:18:28
So for the SKU, I don't know if there's, Bo's talked a lot about having our PIM.
Speaker 2 00:18:34
Abby just mentioned, hit the term PIM, too.
Speaker 3 00:18:36
Yeah, and it's, I forget what it, product information management or something, it's a catalog, product catalog.
Speaker 2 00:18:41
Yeah.
Speaker 3 00:18:41
And that's where we maintain all that SKU, so that's something we're talking, we've been talking about building, we just.
Speaker 2 00:18:47
She brought it up. I am looking at IDLS. Yeah, if you look in there.
Speaker 3 00:18:53
There is a in the that DMV architecture docs. Yeah, Kian did a nice Yeah, because that's something on my list.
Speaker 2 00:19:08
Littletim and then DAR. Yeah, what is that one? I don't know. That's a new one.
Speaker 3 00:19:15
I made a plug in that we search for acronyms, But I don't have it in front of me I can't remember what that one is now, But, um, so there is a Littletim design doc I will read through this Yeah, Kian put together He looked at some open source PMs And they just didn't fit well And so this was the thing.
Speaker 3 00:19:45
together i think he might have some i don't remember if he has this yeah he had it that that might have been a different document years ago did he do that years ago i can't honest to god i i can't remember what was this year and what was two years ago i did see something PIM related.
Speaker 2 00:20:06
from like three years ago this and i wasn't sure if that was the most one but that was a.
Speaker 3 00:20:12
2024 december of 2024. okay so this is well you know a year old are there other locations.
Speaker 2 00:20:25
on a big video there are other like decision videos or.
Speaker 3 00:20:30
meetings that were recorded where decisions occur not these kinds of decisions usually i mean for the lot well he still does but when we were up where you guys are, Kiana and I sat next together, so a lot of it was just pull me over, I'll look at it. Everything should be captured in this document. So, yeah, this would be a good place to start. But we probably, this would probably end up, the UI for this would probably end up manifested in,
Speaker 3 00:21:04
which is our, like, you know, internal. So you were saying about, you know, let somebody, so it would probably be that, you know, somebody on the client service uses comms, and they would be able to go in and update you.
Speaker 2 00:21:21
Okay, and what, actually, that's a good, I wasn't aware of the team name, client services.
Speaker 3 00:21:27
I think that's the team name, and titles change, like, week after week, and it's Russell. I know the person.
Speaker 2 00:21:40
It's the one person.
Speaker 3 00:21:41
You know, it's Russell and his team. He's got a team of people.
Speaker 2 00:21:44
Yeah, okay.
Speaker 3 00:21:44
They're there. In fact, that's why Russell is kind of the, he's the, even though he's not on product, he's like the product representative because he's the one.
Speaker 2 00:21:59
He has to be. Do you guys have any team meetings or anything like that, team sessions. 
Speaker 3 00:22:08
We just have a, right now, again, everything's been so disjointed the last couple months. We used to have more regular stuff, but we have a stand-up once a week for data, but it was kind of architecture and data, but now that data's moved under BRID, we haven't figured out, so we're just kind of keePIMg it going. Okay. Yeah, there's not a lot.
Speaker 2 00:22:31
If there's anything else that you think I would benefit from being a part of.
Speaker 3 00:22:35
Yeah, I will try to pull you, I mean, it's right now, and it's, I mean, it's a bit bad, because I just haven't had the time to do my teams. I'm doing them a disservice right now, because I'm so lost in office. But yeah, when we start getting into those, mostly we've been looking at solving more technical problems. One of the things, it's just stuff that we keep seeing coming out. One of them is retry logic with queues and stuff, and how do we longer term retry. We're trying to come up with a pattern.
Speaker 2 00:23:18
Yeah, anything that you have, because I'm focusing right now, or trying to, on the business reasons. And I think I want to help kind of bridge that gap.
Speaker 3 00:23:35
Yeah, the big thing there is where they could really use help on the product side is we end up with these more technical questions. A lot of times it's, oh, like yesterday, how do we know when someone moves out of state?
Speaker 3 00:24:06
And what are the downstream systems that need to know that somebody moved out of state? And what is it that triggers that? What is the thing that triggers that? And because AMBA can send us a champed state of record, that doesn't necessarily mean that they moved out of state. It just might mean that they bought a house.
Speaker 2 00:24:29
How do we handle those things. 
Speaker 3 00:24:31
There is a death file that comes in.
Speaker 2 00:24:36
So they're not actually changing you.
Speaker 3 00:24:41
Right. Well, there is some stuff. Again, we don't know. That's on development side. It's like, okay, we know we need to do certain things. We know we need to, like, Isaac found an integration that was like, you know, tell us that they're no longer the state of record. It's like, okay, but how do we know that? How do we know that what triggers that? What is that? And that's, you know, where sometimes I think the regular product people, they don't have as much technical background.
Speaker 3 00:25:11
They don't understand that. Here's this big flow that happened.
Speaker 2 00:25:16
Well, there's a lot of flows.
Speaker 3 00:25:17
Yeah. Yeah, a lot of it is, like, looking at data, too, and just, you know, what does it mean? I mean, we had a thing with the Social Security numbers. That's one that Bo's been fighting me on. I keep telling him the real thing. Two million people have the same social security number issued by the United States. Wait, really. 
Speaker 2 00:25:41
So you can't use that as a primary key? No. How does that work? It's a pain in the ass.
Speaker 3 00:25:52
Is that like legacy, or are they still getting... No, I think it's legacy, but I think it was in the 1960s, because they had a security office state issue, and somebody issued you one that somebody else issued, and they didn't keep track of it.
Speaker 2 00:26:05
So that problem will go away, eventually.
Speaker 3 00:26:08
Eventually. But they have it in their data. Go away. But they have it in their data. There are multiple things. And Bo's like, we don't want to handle that. We should just say it's unique. It's like, okay, but somebody walks in, tries to get a credential, they move to another state, and they've got the same social security number we already have in the system. You just tell them no. That's a good point. I mean, you have to handle it, but that's the kind of stuff that, you know, like people on that, you know, the product doesn't quite understand the effects of that.
Speaker 3 00:26:44
It's a huge thing.
Speaker 2 00:26:45
If you can't have that be a unique idea. Yeah. If there was one thing you wanted from me in the next month or so, what would it be. 
Speaker 3 00:26:57
I want you to create an extra month this year to get more done. Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:27:12
Just something to think about. Yeah.
Speaker 3 00:27:14
Yeah, I mean, certainly, like one of the things, you know, that I want to do that I haven't been able to do in this month is I wanted to have like sequence diagrams and business flows for a lot of these, especially for like the integration. just some of these things so if any of those if you can create diagrams for any of those, that would be helpful you know you could create a new design document if you want in that same dmv architecture docs for integration specifically it could be for integrations.
Speaker 3 00:27:45
it just i was hoping because what i was hoping to do was stay ahead of the team create a diagram here's here's how it'll work we do have i do have a general pattern and that's out there, i think in the idls design document kind of a general pattern of how the integrations work okay um so you know but i i was hoping to basically do each one but there's just so many to do of the.
Speaker 2 00:28:10
integration yeah integration like when i think of integration i'm actually tying directly into.
Speaker 3 00:28:18
these three yeah so we have we have got cics which is the the front end right, And it talks to all of our various product backends. So we've got IDLS Core, which is our IDLS backend. And then we have an IDLS Integration Service. I can't remember now whether they split it in two or not because we talked about it. But I think we also have an IDLS AMVA Integration Service.
Speaker 3 00:28:48
And IDLS Core, when certain things happen, will send off a message to one of the, put a message on a queue that one of the integration services will pick up to trigger something that I'm trying to think if that's, no, it's an event. It's an event. So there's an event put on, so it's like basically a topic that, you know, any of these integration services just subscribe to the topics that, look, when I see a message on this topic, I run.
Speaker 3 00:29:21
So new driver's license created. That may trigger 20. Five of the three, yeah. Different integrations of having to let some other some other system. No integration almost being an acronym. Just something you can be it can also be I mean it can also be a batch So it might like that might end up triggering them to save it so that in that night's fashion batch.
Speaker 2 00:29:49
It gets set out, but those are integrations typically endpoint call out. Yeah.
Speaker 3 00:29:58
Third-party system, right? Yeah, so all those now like the amber ones can also be like verification So like when we start a new credential or an issue any new credential Yeah, it'll send it says hey I need this verified and the integration called all the various systems that needs to do that Validations start sending back the responses one by one, It's supposed to be built so that they can keep working and, like, in the background, they're receiving, you know,
Speaker 3 00:30:29
yep, valid, and then they get to a certain point that they can't go any further until they've gotten all the responses. But so just a lot of these just, you know, those flows, if they had diagrams to go with them, would be so helpful.
Speaker 2 00:30:47
Not just stigma flows. 
Speaker 3 00:30:49
Yeah. I mean, actual, right, actual sequence diagrams that talk, you know, this is how the systems talk to each other. Because this is going to be, when we hand this, like, my hope was I would be able to do these and then they'd become documentation for handing over to Louisiana. But this is the flow that these go in. Right. So if you want to know what's talking to what, you know, it's just really a big, yeah, we have the front ends, stigmas and stuff, but it's the, you know, how do all these systems talk to each other?
Speaker 3 00:31:19
When do they talk to each other? What triggers it? in the standardized language of the CMYK. Yeah. Either sequence diagram or activity diagram. Yeah. Just something for someone to look at and say, oh, okay, this is the order that things happen. Then we'll translate it to a pretty PowerPoint.
Speaker 2 00:31:40
Yeah. Right. Well, let Bo do that.
Speaker 3 00:31:43
Yeah. Here, Bo, make this look nice.
Speaker 2 00:31:50
I don't got anything else, yeah. Okay. This was very informative for me. Well, good.
Speaker 3 00:31:53
And, yeah, I mean, feel free to stop by any time. I do not mind.
Speaker 2 00:31:58
Okay. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate it. I've been just trying to get my feet wet with a little. Yeah. I have this whole week. Actually, I had it all Monday and Tuesday. Yeah. And then, like, no one was in yesterday. So I was like, I'm just going to push them out. Yeah. So this whole week is slowly becoming these types of chats. Yeah.
Speaker 3 00:32:15
I'm out on it. Yeah. Bye.
Speaker 2 00:32:25
Well, thank you, sir. Oh, sure. Yeah, I appreciate it. A lot of good stuff here. Yeah, that is around violations. Yes. Yeah, I'm excited for that one. Mostly because I just get to listen. And you're out in Strongsville, right? Okay. Where are you at? Berea. Oh, okay. So I wish I could jump right on 71.
Speaker 4 00:32:50
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:32:51
I have to, I dropped my kids off in Ridgeville first. And so then the 480-71 interchange is horrible.
Speaker 3 00:32:58
So what do you do. 
Speaker 2 00:32:59
I drop them off in Ridgeville, and then it's by that intersection, like the Autoroute, the intersection there, right by 480. So then I just pop on 480-71.
Speaker 4 00:33:10
Oh, okay.
Speaker 2 00:33:10
Yeah, it adds probably five-ish minutes. Yeah. But I could go back down Cook Road. And then just get right on 71. But at that point, it's like, I'm going the same way. All right, sir. Good chatting. Thank you.

## 1. Role and Structure of the Architecture Group
### Conclusion
The architecture group’s role has shifted from proactive work (e.g., developing the reference architecture) to a reactive model where architects are assigned to specific projects due to high workload. The desired state is to get ahead of initiatives, but currently they are focused on maintaining capacity and “keeping their heads above water.”
### Discussion Points
1. [Tyler]: The architecture group is effectively loaned out to projects for decision-making rather than having centralized focus or authority.
2. [Speaker 3]: There is a gap between what the group wants to do (proactive work like reference architecture) and what it is forced to do (reactive project assignments).
   - Recently, architects like Justin, Kian, and Kerry have been assigned to specific projects or domains (e.g., Kerry on data) to manage the workload.
## 2. UDM (Unified Data Model) Status and Maintenance
### Conclusion
The UDM design document page is outdated. The source of truth is the ‘doing’ GitHub repo, which contains Flyway scripts that can generate a complete local database. The current process involves taking the auto-generated single diagram from the repo and manually breaking it into separate schema diagrams for the design document.
### Plan
- [ ] Run Flyway scripts from the ‘doing’ GitHub repo to create a local database and understand the current UDM structure. -- *Tyler*
- [ ] Bring up the UDM project locally using the Docker Compose file to set up the database and run Flyway. -- *Tyler*
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 3]: The UDM page sent to Tyler is not up to date.
   - Updates have been done “when I get a chance.”
2. [Speaker 3]: The source of truth for UDM is the ‘doing’ GitHub repo.
   - The repo contains Flyway scripts that generate a PlainUML diagram and can create a local database with all schemas, tables, and stored procedures.
   - A Docker Compose file can bring up the database and run Flyway.
3. [Tyler]: The fees engine is being built for Louisiana but needs an extensible architecture.
## 3. Fees Engine Architecture and State-Specific Logic
### Conclusion
The fees engine, primarily led by Kian, is likely state-deployed, with each state having its own instance populated only with its specific SKUs to prevent data mixing. Complex, state-specific calculation logic is implemented via hard-coded Java plugins, chosen after prior attempts with database rules and tools like Camunda proved inefficient or overly complex for the scaling model. Tyler can join discussions with Speaker 3 and Kian about the structure.
### Plan
- [ ] Involve Speaker 3 in discussions with Kian on the fees engine’s data structure and normalization. -- *Tyler* *Speaker 3* *Kian*
- [ ] Develop a concept/proof of potential improvements for the fees engine as a learning exercise. -- *Tyler*
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 3]: Kian has been leading the fees engine; Speaker 3 has been reviewing his work.
2. [Tyler]: Fees engine tables seemed to lack a state identifier for SKUs, implying global scope.
3. [Speaker 3]: The engine is likely state-deployed by default to avoid mixing data; absence of a state identifier in SKUs aligns with per-state instances.
4. [Tyler]: Final SKU determination appears to be a large, hard-coded, state-specific flow (e.g., Louisiana).
5. [Speaker 3]: “Hard-coded” logic is implemented via Java plugins by design to scale effectively.
   - Deploy the same core code to all states; customizations handled via plugins, similar to Salesforce’s platform upgrade model.
   - Storing complex rules in the database was too complex (akin to inventing a new language); the team chose Java since they have Java developers.
   - Camunda models had performance issues and still required programmers, making plain Java preferable.
## 4. Alternative Approaches to Business Logic Implementation
### Conclusion
Tyler proposed exploring a highly configurable, point-and-click or BPMN-based tool to internally model business logic, potentially enabling non-developers to create flows. Speaker 3 is open but cautious, citing negative experiences with Camunda (performance issues, complexity for non-programmers, licensing changes). The trade-off is that tools simple enough for non-programmers may be insufficient for complex rules.
### Discussion Points
1. [Tyler]: A configurable or point-and-click tool could help internal teams model logical flows from discovery sessions without relying solely on Java developers.
   - Could handle outliers or updates where logic is adjusted in a “not Java” environment.
2. [Speaker 3]: Trade-off: simplicity for non-programmers vs. power needed for complex rules.
3. [Speaker 3]: Prior Camunda use was unsuccessful.
   - Performance lagged vs. plain Java.
   - Models grew too complex; programmers were needed anyway.
   - Camunda’s open-source licensing changes were a major factor in abandoning it.
4. [Tyler]: Exploring an open-source BPMN modeler (possibly Flowable-based) and working on a proof of concept.
## 5. Product Information Management (PIM) and SKU Control
### Conclusion
A Product Information Management (PIM) system is needed as a central product catalog for SKUs. After finding open-source options unsuitable, Kian created a PIM design document in December 2024. The UI would likely be an internal tool, enabling a team like Russell’s client services to manage SKU changes rather than granting states direct control.
### Discussion Points
1. [Tyler]: SKU pricing control should remain internal, managed by a non-dev team rather than states.
2. [Speaker 3]: Bo has proposed building a PIM to serve as a SKU catalog.
   - The team has been discussing building this.
3. [Speaker 3]: Kian created a PIM design document in the DMV architecture docs.
   - Done in December 2024 after analyzing and rejecting open-source PIMs.
4. [Speaker 3]: The PIM UI would likely be part of an internal tool for teams like Russell’s client services to update SKUs.
## 6. Creating Business Flow and Integration Diagrams
### Conclusion
There is a significant need for sequence/activity diagrams for business flows and system integrations. Speaker 3 requested Tyler’s help to document how backend systems (IDLS Core, IDLS Integration Service, IDLS AMVA Integration Service) communicate, what triggers interactions, and the event order. This documentation is vital for internal understanding and client hand-offs (e.g., Louisiana).
### Plan
- [ ] Create sequence or activity diagrams for business flows and system integrations. -- *Tyler*
- [ ] Add these as new design documents in the ‘dmv architecture docs’ repository. -- *Tyler*
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 3]: A key unmet task is creating sequence diagrams/business flows for integrations.
   - These will document system interactions, triggers, and timing.
2. [Speaker 3]: Backend architecture includes multiple services.
   - CICS is the front end.
   - IDLS Core is the main backend.
   - IDLS Integration Service and IDLS AMVA Integration Service handle third-party communications.
   - Events published to topics trigger integrations; e.g., “new driver’s license created” event triggers multiple services.
3. [Speaker 3]: These diagrams are needed for client documentation (e.g., Louisiana).
## 7. Data Challenges and Product Team Gaps
### Conclusion
The product team sometimes lacks the technical background to grasp downstream effects of certain data realities, creating development challenges. A key example: Social Security Numbers are not unique—about two million people share SSNs due to legacy issuance—making SSN unsuitable as a unique identifier. The business side may not fully grasp the implications of handling non-unique cases. Another challenge is defining precise business triggers for technical events, such as determining when a person has officially moved out of state.
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 3]: The product side needs help bridging technical questions, like defining the exact trigger for “moved out of state.”
   - An AMVA “changed state of record” message doesn’t necessarily mean a person moved; the development team needs the specific business event trigger.
2. [Speaker 3]: SSNs are not unique.
   - About two million people share SSNs due to 1960s legacy issues.
   - This complicates using SSN as a unique identifier; a new resident might have an SSN already in the system for someone else.
   - The product side (e.g., Bo) may want to treat SSN as unique, but systems must handle real-world edge cases.
> **AI Suggestions**
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. **Lack of Formal Architecture Meetings:** Formal, regular architecture team meetings are not happening due to high workloads and disjointed team structures, risking inconsistent patterns and siloed work. Establish a recurring architecture meeting to review ongoing work, align on patterns (e.g., retry logic), and advance strategic initiatives like PIM.
> 2. **Unresolved Approach for Business Logic Configuration:** No path forward was decided on configurable, non-Java tools. Schedule a dedicated session for Tyler to present the proof-of-concept to Speaker 3 and Kian to assess feasibility, performance, and complexity versus needs.
> 3. **Ambiguity in Defining Business Triggers:** Business definitions for technical triggers (e.g., “moved out of state”) are unclear. Assign the product team, with Tyler’s support, to work with stakeholders to define and document these triggers for key events.
> 4. **PIM System Development is Stalled:** Despite a design document and recognized need, there is no active plan or timeline. Prioritize the PIM project, assign resources, and establish a development roadmap.
