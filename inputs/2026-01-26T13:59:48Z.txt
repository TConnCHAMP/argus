Speaker 1 00:00:00
hey can you hear me okay yep yeah perfect hey there so no uh not braving the snow today.
Speaker 2 00:00:12
you aren't yeah i don't blame you so yeah i walked here and there's about a foot of snow on the ground it's crazy oh no are you i am in the office oh you are you're just on the other.
Speaker 1 00:00:25
side maybe yeah one of the one of the brick walls so yeah there's not too many people in here but you know yeah i picked up my uh my parking pass and that was an adventure just enough so.
Speaker 2 00:00:40
oh you got uh for the lot it's fancy yeah there you go do we subsidize that or is it.
Speaker 1 00:00:48
it's like pre-tax but no right yeah not yet yeah.
Speaker 3 00:01:54
Yeah, there he is.
Speaker 4 00:02:00
Hey, got a party.
Speaker 2 00:02:04
everybody you know i mentioned it on stand-up and everybody's like that sounds like so much fun please invite me.
Speaker 5 00:02:11
all right guys so basically what i was telling jimmy is that when i was going through all of these different policies and procedures um i started to find some of the workflows which dan has consumed and he's working through that um but as part of that i was trying to give some thought around like what the the engine would look or not the engine but the fee structure like how we're going to store those fees um so that they can support also the front end.
Speaker 5 00:02:44
can you hear screaming kids in my house because i'm about to lose my mind no good okay good just me uh snow day it's great um so and then i tried to put together like an excel document just to see kind of the feasibility what it actually worked and um so i just thought, I'll dive in. And then what I told Jamie is like, this is, this would probably be a good base for you guys to consider like, all right, let's maybe build from this and add to it or change it. But at least it gives you a little thought of like, you know, we got to be able to handle partial payments, right? We have to be able to handle fees that come in through licensing. So renewals and duplicates. We also have to be able to handle reinstatement fees that come out of nowhere, late fees, payment plans. So it's like all of those things I tried to keep into.
Speaker 5 00:03:32
Or consider when building this out. So let me just share my whole, let me see what I got up here. So I'll share this, the structure first, and then we'll go from there. The question is, is where the hell is it? I need, I need your. whatever you call this. There you go. The bar to go away. Okay. So let's kind of dive into,
Speaker 5 00:04:14
let's start here. So my thought process here was from a front end perspective. Oh, the other thing I should caveat is that I don't really know how the cart's going to work yet. Just because I feel like you're going to be able to select things that can go in a cart and some things that don't go in the cart, some things can be paid now, some things can be paid later. So how does that cart actually manifest? I don't know. But let's just talk through the transactions at a high level and you guys can start asking questions. But what I wanted to be able to do is represent if you actually went and did a renewal of a Class C license, like high level roll up, it's going to cost you $35, $25.
Speaker 5 00:04:51
But what that actually breaks down to is there's a license fee, a handling fee, and a service fee. So I kind of was thinking these as like your transaction or your item and then these are like fee items, these individual. Nothing crazy here, but a way to kind of tell what type of transaction it is. The reference ID was for a couple of things. One, it could be an application because according to the product team, it seems like everything will most things start with an application.
Speaker 5 00:05:21
So if it's a renewal or a new license, there is some sort of like an application ID we could reference. The other thing this could reference would could be potentially like a payment plan ID for a late fee. So this concept, maybe we want, maybe we don't. But that was the concept behind a reference ID is where does this transaction come from or what is it related to? Um, this could be your description, right? It was an installment plan or maybe it's an app ID. Um, and then on, at this level, I was thinking we would have the amount owed and then to handle partial payments. Like if there's a remaining balance, um, what's the current status of this transaction? So is it paid pending partial payment? Um, we do need to know the servicing office that's doing this because based on that servicing office, it was what drives that service fee. Um, sometimes it's zero.
Speaker 5 00:06:11
Sometimes it's, it varies depending on the office. And then at a fee item level, um, a little bit more detailed, this is where you get your state SKU IDs. Um, the concept here is that, just to kind of go a little bit behind what I was thinking originally, if we kind of start to look at some of these different flows, right, when you get to a decision point, like let's say you are adding an endorsement, this should look up the state SKU, right? And that state SKU gets put on.
Speaker 5 00:06:42
the table. The reason I want to kind of have it more of like architected that way so that in the future, you're always going to end up at that endorsement. The rules aren't going to change, but the amount you pay for that transaction can change from year to year. So on the state SKU table, which we'll get into, right, there's a, it basically has a start and end date. So we can say for all of 2025, an endorsement costs $7, but starting in 2026, it's going to cost you $8, right? And it allows us to adjust the fees and the prices based on the SKUs, but not have to.
Speaker 5 00:07:13
change any actual underlying logic in the system to support that change. So back up here. So this is where we would have a state skew and a description, the amount of that state skew to be associated there. And then I was thinking you're going to have to be able to handle discounts. There's a couple of different types of discounts. The main one right now in Louisiana is something called a cap fee. Whereas if you have.
Speaker 5 00:07:46
They feel bad for you because they charge you so much for lapse in insurance coverage that there's a nine hundred dollar cap essentially per day or an eight hundred fifty dollar cap per day that they're willing to pay. So if you have two vehicles and you've exceeded 90 plus days with no insurance, they're going to charge you five hundred dollars per vehicle plus a twenty five dollar admin fee per vehicle. So technically you would owe them a thousand fifty. Fifty. Well, they have a cap fee where like, well, you only have to pay eight fifty if you pay it all off today, plus the two admin fees.
Speaker 5 00:08:21
So really you pay me nine hundred bucks. So we need a way to basically represent there's that that's been applied. The other type of discounts are, you know, maybe it's a manager override, right? The credential printed funny or printed something incorrect. You have to reprint it. So you would zero out. That's not going to cost anything. The DMV has to pay for that at OMV. So that's kind of the transaction and the transaction related fee items, I was thinking. To support payments, there's got to be an interim table between payments and transactions, because we have to take partial payments or multiple payments, or maybe we do split tender payments, right? So there's got to be kind of a linking table, which I can show you.
Speaker 5 00:09:05
But I want to be able to track, basically, some information about that payment, you know, what type of payment was, how much was the payment for, what office took that, you know, is there a payment plan that's associated with it, because that's an option as well. And then there's a status of that payment plan. And then the state SKU, which we talked about, which for every single... Fee in the state. Right. We want to have a corresponding state skew from every vehicle class to renewals to endorsements.
Speaker 5 00:09:46
Also, those would be something we would have for reinstatements as well. Some notes that I've made in here is like going through some of the different integrations, like there's a bunch of stuff that are related to fees that don't really make sense in a fee table. But when we get to reinstatements, we're going to have to talk about where do we store things like this? Right. Because we're going to be getting documents in from courts that have, you know, a court code, a receipt number, a case number, like all of that shit.
Speaker 5 00:10:17
We have to support somehow some way related to basically adding a violation. So, unrelated to fees, but just calling out, there are additional things that we will need to track for violations that get added that ultimately turn into a fee. But before I go into the actual Excel document, which I think makes this a little bit cleaner, any high-level concerns, issues, conversations you guys want to have. 
Speaker 1 00:10:51
I had a quick question, Ian. Maybe it's a softball question here for you. Sure. Your fee, the state SKU table fee item, are you thinking that this would be for all states and all SKUs, or would this be a table specific to each state. 
Speaker 5 00:11:11
Yeah. So, good question. So, the concept is, which we don't have yet, but we're trying to put in a PIM in CHAMP where it's like… You know, product information management where we have, you know, yes, we have, if you think about licensure class E, right? So we'd have a general license class E SKU, but I want them to be state specific. So if we go over and pop over to here, I started to kind of think about what I want them to look like. And I think what we need to come up with is what is a structure that we want for these fees as well.
Speaker 5 00:11:47
So I was originally thinking we'd go start with product, then it's the state, potentially the class. And then there's, if there's an attribute, an optional location, optional restriction. So like, this would be your standard six year class A, B, or C license SKU, right? going all the way down to like because it gets funky here with they have different levels to based on your age based on the location you live in um but i wanted the skews to be in such a way.
Speaker 5 00:12:17
that we can identify what state they're associated with because not every state will have the same set of fees as well um it's not a bad conversation to have like if you think about like a true, pimp sometimes you have a high level product let's say it's just like classy and then you have a bunch of attributes underneath it right what could be a six-year licensure a 70 plus which changes the pricing associated with that high level um product skill.
Speaker 5 00:12:47
but because we don't have a pimp yet and i don't know what we're going to do i don't know if that works yet so um i'll definitely run these skews, across Bo's desk to make sure he's in alignment with me before I would say go something like this. But that's kind of the concept is we need to, we just need a consistent way to build out our SKUs. We've done it with ELT and I want to do something similar here with, with credentialing.
Speaker 6 00:13:16
So I started trying to pull like all these tabs into one look, Ian, or like for me, like it was easier just to see it like all in one place. Right. Um, I've just been working locally cause it's, you know, like it's just me like sketching stuff out. Um, so if you guys are going to take, can I assume then like you guys will figure out what that, what the SKU, what the SKUs look like. Um, like I shouldn't be working on trying to figure that out. Cause that's what it sounds like is you guys are going to take that and then I'll just, we'll just pop them into the flows where it makes sense.
Speaker 5 00:13:49
Yeah. Let me, let me get sign off on this. first of all kind of like this pattern um and then if he's on board with these and then you're right i could say these have been approved then you can plug these into your your tickets okay.
Speaker 6 00:14:03
cool yeah i mean just just for me i was trying to like take like each tab and be like what are we looking at because like you said there's they're all kind of wonky all over the place.
Speaker 5 00:14:13
yeah um so this was me trying to put it into like reality so if i actually set these tables up and populated them like could we support the use cases i just talked about um so this is your high level transaction table so we have a class e renewal right that has essentially uh a fee items related to it which are three individual fee items that make up the 32 or 35 25, And then if a customer comes in and makes a payment against that, right, this is just a single payment.
Speaker 5 00:14:44
So it's really straightforward. They're making a credit card payment. Right. We have a one to one relationship in this payments table that says this particular transaction, this payment was related to this transaction. Right. The amount they paid. Right. Was the full amount. So we consider this paid. We consider this paid. Right. Right. It gets a little bit this one gets a little wonky because this is kind of a good situation from like you have multiple things in your cart.
Speaker 5 00:15:15
Like, how do we how do we deal with that? Right. So if you put in a reinstatement, so they had a violation, they had a DUI offense, they had one hundred dollars they owe for that. And they're renewing their license. Right. So they technically owe us one hundred thirty seven twenty five. Um, these three trends that are four transactions are related to those two, right? Those are the fee items that are related to them, but they want to make a single payment, right. To pay for both of those. So they give us a payment of 137, 25 and a check, right? We then would have to apply that across both of those transactions to mark them pay. Like in theory, in my head, it sounds reasonable from a logical perspective. It's not terrible, but like, these are the things I need you guys to consider.
Speaker 5 00:16:04
When you're trying to figure out a, how do we program it to these tables really work? Does this seem good in theory, but doesn't work. But so I'm just trying to cover the different use cases and yes, it supports it, but like the difficulty of programming it as a, as a different thing. Right. The other thing I kind of wanted to point out here is like one of these, I did one of these with partial payment. So like reinstatement, let's say 80, 90, I want to do one of the payment plan, PP, let.
Speaker 5 00:16:35
me do this one. So let's imagine we're taking a payment plan, payment on this one, right? So if they set up, a customer can come in and basically say, I don't have the money for the reinstatement, can you put me on a payment plan? So we need to basically track that this transaction at a high level is being, has been paid, right? Or is being paid. Let's go with that. it should be associated to a payment plan so that we know it's on payment plan because that's.
Speaker 5 00:17:08
important to know that. And then as we take payments from them, right, they may come in and pay like $25 a transaction. And we're going to get these through Tyler Tech. I need to be able to basically say, all right, from this integration file, I have taken a $25 payment from this customer that's associated to this particular transaction or this reinstatement fee, right? Take the payment, mark the payment, and then I got to decrement the amount they owe us by 25 bucks,
Speaker 5 00:17:40
right? The same thing can happen if they miss a payment. I can go ahead and instead of there being a payment, I may create a new transaction that they owe us, which is an unpaid, like you missed your monthly payment, you owe me $25 late fee. Right. Um, so with those payment plans, I'm either going to basically take in a payment or I'm going to create a new fee as a $25 late fee. And that would be part of the integration process. Um, not that it's really specific to fees, but just so you guys have awareness, if they.
Speaker 5 00:18:18
end up defaulting on their payments, their payment plan, um, and let's say they missed the last two months. So they got a $25 fee the last two months. They can enter into a new payment plan to pay off the remaining balance. However, any late fees that have occurred have to be paid at the time that they're sitting in front of the clerk before they can get put into a new payment plan because payment plans don't consider previous late fees. So they would have to pay us the $50, let's say in late fees, we'd have to tender that.
Speaker 5 00:18:50
out. And then we'd create a new payment plan for them for the remaining tasks. Um. One of the things we do need to make sure that, which I kind of accounted for here, but I don't know if I truly did, but we do need to make sure that we have identified, and maybe this reference ID is enough, maybe we need something a little bit more explicit, but we need to make sure that we know which of the violations, because you can only do payments plans for basically violations or reinstatement fees, which ones have been associated with a payment plan, right?
Speaker 5 00:19:26
Because what will happen is one customer may be in a payment plan, right, for these two, and then they get a new violation that's not part of the payment plan, right? So we need to make sure we associate which transactions or which reinstatement fees are associated with that particular payment plan. I didn't really get into setting up the payment plan table in here. I kind of started to a little bit, but like... Um, right now there's no real integration for this. It's all kind of manually input by the clerk. Um, so I don't know how much information we can actually gather. Dan, this would be something maybe you could look into. Um, like, do we want to gather this amount of information or do we basically just want to say they're in a payment plan? Here's the start date. Here's the expected end date. Um, I know these details exist. It's just a matter of how difficult are they to get from, from an analyst perspective.
Speaker 5 00:20:25
Um, so anyways, so obviously the goal here is to be able to support all the different kinds of use cases. We have partial payments, payments coming in from third parties. Like we'll get payments from the office of debt recovery. We'll get payments from Tyler tech. We'll get payments from analysts. So there's three ways that we can get payments into the systems. There's also multiple ways we can put, um, fees into a particular customer's account, right? They walk in and request something. They've been court issued. They violate a payment plan. So we just have to be able to support those different use cases in this model. So I'll pause. Does it look like something you guys want to take back?
Speaker 5 00:21:19
think through i mean my goal here jimmy obviously is just to give you some some base level knowledge of how i came across these structures um and obviously you may find that it doesn't work or the way you guys have to work with the cart doesn't work great but i just kind of wanted to give you guys a base level of these are the things i was thinking about i think all the use cases i said would work this from a programming perspective that's where i.
Speaker 2 00:21:45
need you guys to kind of weigh in yeah i think it's good um we haven't really thought past the cart too much so like okay you know we'll obviously mock it for uat um but it sounds like you know when we're for example issuing a new driver's license class e you know we, We take the driver's license type, plus the class, plus whatever, kind of plug it into this fees engine, use that as the SKU to get the fees required for that, kind of display them in the cart, and then we'll need to, I guess, keep track of that transaction even after they've paid or partially paid and it's left the cart.
Speaker 2 00:22:37
We need to maybe store it in this transaction table and then link all these payment plan stuff, and I haven't really thought about it past then.
Speaker 5 00:22:49
Yeah, and I know a lot of that comes in with violations, so you guys have an easy use case up front, which is ideal. It gets more challenging with reinstatement because now you have these kind of partial payments, payment plans, fees coming in from unexpected sources.
Speaker 7 00:23:09
Ian, I have a question. How much of the rules that are associated with these different kinds of fees about what can and can't happen, how much of that's going to be enforced by the data model and I guess the code in front of it versus the clerk or the analyst doing the correct thing? Like how much freedom does the analyst have to kind of do what they want. 
Speaker 5 00:23:30
Uh, yeah. So I, I originally tried to, to your point, I thought, and you know, feel free to look at this shit, but I was originally thinking, what if I had the data model drive this workflow and these business flows? Like, could I find a way for the data model to make the decisions, right? Based on you input these parameters, what is your age? Where do you live? Where are you getting this service done? And what's the transaction type, right? And so I initially went down that road thinking, gosh, let's, that would be so great. Cause then it's all data driven, right? And like,
Speaker 5 00:24:03
okay, so now our, our fee engine is like all database and sounded really good in theory. And then I started to look at the state specific rules and I got to this and I'm like, this is a nightmare, right? So like, how do I, how do I still simplify? Like the fact that I need to be able to adjust fees, or I don't want to have to change all of the logic on how we figured out what they're owed or what they owe us, but yet allow the flexibility in the future. for fee changes and so to your point i don't think there's a lot of flexibility in the front end i.
Speaker 5 00:24:36
think you're going to be doing a renewal you're going to be doing a new issuance right you're going to send in like i said what is their current age where are they getting the service done and where do they live and it's like those five things will drive all of these different decision points, um and then my goal would be is coming out of one of these flows right you will end up with a list of fees um what would be interesting to see is when what i don't know how we're going to do this yet is like and again this is something i think you guys need to think through is like.
Speaker 5 00:25:10
when we're building out this this transaction items table right like, I take it all back. We'll know this. The reason this has to be built this way is because, like I said, based on where you live, the licensing fee for a class E is different, right? If you're in Orleans, you pay six dollars more versus everywhere else in the state. Or if you're getting it done in Alexandria versus Orleans, like you have to pay three dollars. So like it got very difficult from a data perspective. So that's why I went down the flow perspective with the concept of allowing some flexibility within the fees. And then to kind of answer your other point, the way they're the way they're building out the cart, which I'm sure you guys are well aware of, is that the ability to override. Right.
Speaker 5 00:26:01
That's when the analyst has like that option to say, OK, now I need to discount this or zero out this because of X, Y or Z, which gives them. Kind of that authority to kind of do whatever they need to do.
Speaker 7 00:26:16
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So they have a little bit of flexibility on like particular administrative discounts are allowed to add. So the analyst can't do anything invalid. It's going to be enforced by the decision engine in code, which is fine. And additionally, some somewhat of like the static data in the database.
Speaker 5 00:26:35
Correct. Correct. And I think that we even need some sort of a manager level clearance to make the change. I don't know.
Speaker 6 00:26:45
That's the thought process right now.
Speaker 5 00:26:46
Yeah. And this is the part that Jimmy, I'm not exactly, you know, clearly a cart's associated to a customer, right? A customer has a cart and there can be things put in that cart. Right. But like. I don't know. It's not like a one to one. So you actually need to make a reference table for the number of items that are associated to the current cart. Or this is your kind of your items associated is what I was thinking. So here's my cart. I referenced that cart ID, but I can have multiple items. So I could pull over like a handicap placard and a renewal, right? Or a reinstatement and whatever. And it's associated to the cart.
Speaker 5 00:27:25
Whether you guys persist that until the next time they show up, there's no reason you couldn't, right? But that was my initial thought. Like, I think the cart is just more of a reference to what you're going to be applying a payment to. So you're going to pick the transactions, essentially, that will be in the cart. And then obviously on, approval or tendering or whatever it is to that transaction is completed that's when you start applying the payment across the transactions those kind of things i was also thinking which i don't.
Speaker 5 00:27:59
know from a product perspective dan but i'm assuming we're not we're not maintaining views of all this stuff right it's if you make a payment for a renewal of a license class or you make a payment to pay off your reinstatement right that probably just becomes an audit log or whatever we're calling them these days yeah okay yeah so once those things are paid right it just becomes like hey here's the payment and here's the activity that happened that take that took that payment yeah because we don't need it for anything else like once it's processed yeah okay um yeah and.
Speaker 5 00:28:32
jimmy i think the only time a customer well an analyst gets an opportunity to select what fees they're going to pay is when they're reinstatements right so like if you have a dui, and you have a dui and you have a dui and you have a dui and you have a um, Not you personally. I wouldn't believe you'd have one. But anyways, but if you had a DUI and you had a cancellation of insurance, it is it is much more important that that individual pays off that insurance reinstatement as fast as possible because that one keeps growing in cost.
Speaker 5 00:29:04
So if they can pay that one off, they can say, well, I'll come back later and do the other one, but I need to pay this one off today. That's when they're like the cart becomes optional on what you can pay. Anyway, it's in the current situation where we're talking about issuance and renewals. Right. You're just you have to pay it no matter what. So like that, you have the easiest use case first and then it gets a little bit more challenging. All of these challenges, like I said, they come they come in violations and reinstatements. So I just wanted to have some awareness and I wanted to think this through for those use cases.
Speaker 2 00:29:40
Yeah, it's good to know where it's going for sure. Um, yeah. And I'm even meeting with Kevin at three just to talk through what the schema should look like for all this. Okay. Get, get his ideas. Um, we have an idea for UAT, but this helps to know, you know, what we might need in the future.
Speaker 6 00:30:02
Yeah. And then we're starting on violations. I think we have a meeting tomorrow on the product side. So we're starting to think too. We're trying to figure out like if I'm going to take that because I'm working on fees or whether Nick's going to take it. But yeah, we're starting to think about that stuff too.
Speaker 5 00:30:17
Okay. Yeah. And I think until you get it actually code this thing and interact with how you guys want the user experience to be, this will probably be adjusted. Um, this was not thinking through all of the user experience stuff that you guys are designing on that side. So. There may be some slight changes, but, um, and I'm happy to, uh, jump on at any point with you guys to talk through these. Like if you think I'm completely off or you're trying to figure out like why I did something that I did and you guys just don't see it, like let's, let's chat about it.
Speaker 5 00:30:52
because we got to get this thing right. This is huge. Um, so the more you guys can kind of think through it and make sure it, it does support the use cases that you're, maybe you're aware of that I'm not aware of. Um, I just think we want to make sure that we're all in agreement. Yeah. Sounds good. Okay. You have access to this, Jimmy. Um, Dan, you said you you're cleaning this.
Speaker 6 00:31:19
up. Yeah. I'm going to have another document. I'm not messing with yours. Um, I'm just going.
Speaker 5 00:31:25
to have another one. Okay. Yeah. I mean, mine was a more of a working model. What is this. 
Speaker 2 00:31:32
Where does this live? Is this some. 
Speaker 5 00:31:35
Yeah, it is. I can send it to you for now. But this was me initially trying to figure out like, well, here's all the fees and like what happens in reinstatement and handle. So I was using all of these to build out those workflows I showed you. But I'm happy to, I think this is helpful for you guys to kind of see how I laid it out. So let me, let me at least send you that stuff for now. It's just at SharePoint. Unless Dan, you think you got a better view for them. I don't, I don't really know.
Speaker 6 00:32:02
No, I think it's, it's helpful with what you got. And then I'm going to put whatever I have into Confluence for everybody.
Speaker 4 00:32:08
All right. Let's see you guys right now. All right. Do you want the Excel too, Kyle. 
Speaker 7 00:32:27
Yeah, why not. 
Speaker 5 00:32:28
Okay. I think that everybody. All right. You guys all have that. Should get something to share. Nice little shared email. And the Miro, I think that's, who haven't I shared that with, Tyler. 
Speaker 1 00:32:54
Thanks, just something to plunk around on is what I was hoping for.
Speaker 5 00:32:59
Yeah, I'll send it to you. And Kyle, did I send you that one either? I don't know if I did. I'll send it to you again if I didn't.
Speaker 7 00:33:11
The Miro one. I just sent it again. I don't remember seeing it.
Speaker 5 00:33:17
I threw it in Slack. Okay. All right, guys. I think it's a lot. I think it helps for you guys to go back and digest it and then make sure it works, but definitely feel free to reach out, make any edits you want. This is kind of the handoff. So, and Tyler, I don't know how much you're getting involved with this kind of stuff. Like, are you, are you helping like the architecture team get in here and figure this crap.
Speaker 5 00:33:49
out. 
Speaker 1 00:33:49
I think that's the end state. I'm just trying to understand where we're at today. But yeah, I think I'll be working with Kevin. Jimmy, Jimmy, I was going to ask for an invite to your Kevin meeting later today too. So, uh, yeah, I think I already have a conflict, but, um, whenever you guys are connected, it's great.
Speaker 2 00:34:09
So what, yeah, I don't even know what a product, so you're more on tech side.
Speaker 1 00:34:12
A little of both. I think I lean more product, but I'll be in tuned with the architecture. um again i'm sure i'll be i have some questions already about uh the structure uh what you put.
Speaker 5 00:34:25
together so that kind of stuff yeah um okay sounds good yeah thanks guys appreciate it all right

## Meeting Notes
### Proposed Fee Structure and Engine Logic
*   **Objective**: [Speaker 5] presented a proposed data structure for managing fees to support various transaction types, including renewals, duplicates, reinstatement fees, late fees, and payment plans.
*   **Core Components**:
    *   **Transactions Table**: A high-level record of each transaction (e.g., Class C license renewal), including the total amount owed, remaining balance, and status (paid, pending, partial).
    *   **Fee Items Table**: A detailed breakdown of each transaction into individual fees (e.g., license, handling, service), each linked to a state-specific SKU.
    *   **State SKU Table**: A central catalog of all fee types, with fee amounts adjustable by effective dates (start/end) without changing system logic. SKUs are state-specific.
    *   **Payments Table**: A linking table for payments, supporting partial, multiple, and split-tender payments applied to one or more transactions.
*   **Special Cases Considered**:
    *   **Discounts and Caps**: Must support discounts (e.g., manager overrides) and fee caps (e.g., Louisiana’s $850 cap for lapsed insurance).
    *   **Partial Payments & Payment Plans**: Track remaining balances and tie transactions to specific payment plans.
    *   **Third-Party Payments**: Accept payments from Tyler Tech, the Office of Debt Recovery, and clerks.
### SKU Naming Convention and Management
*   **Proposed Structure**: Standardized SKU naming: `Product - State - Class - [Attribute] - [Optional Location] - [Optional Restriction]`.
*   **Ownership**: Final approval to be obtained from "Bo" before implementation; once approved, SKUs will be integrated into workflows.
*   **Product Information Management (PIM)**: A PIM is a future goal for product/attribute management but is not yet available.
### Cart Functionality and User Experience
*   **Cart Role**: The cart groups transactions a customer intends to pay together.
*   **Payment Application**: After tender, payments are allocated across selected cart transactions. Paid transactions will likely be recorded in an audit log.
*   **Analyst Flexibility**:
    *   Analysts can apply discounts or zero out fees with proper authorization (e.g., manager override).
    *   For reinstatements, analysts can choose specific violations to pay first, since certain fees (like lapsed insurance) accrue over time and need prioritization.
### Violations and Reinstatements
*   **Complexity**: Violations and reinstatements add complexity, including partial payments, payment plans, and fees from unexpected sources.
*   **Data Storage**: Store additional court-related data (e.g., court code, receipt number, case number) when adding violations that create fees.
*   **Payment Plans**:
    *   Typically apply to reinstatement fees.
    *   Upon default, new late fees are generated; these must be paid in full before establishing a new plan for the remaining balance.
## Next Arrangements
- [ ] [Speaker 5] to obtain sign-off from "Bo" on the SKU naming pattern.
- [ ] [Speaker 6] to consolidate documentation in Confluence.
- [ ] Jimmy and Kevin to meet on the fee structure database schema; invite Tyler.
- [ ] Product team to begin discussions on violations.
## AI Suggestions
> **AI Suggestions**
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. The exact mechanism for how the shopping cart will interact with the proposed transaction and fee tables is still conceptual and requires further definition, especially regarding how transactions are stored before, during, and after payment.
> 2. The data model for payment plans was only partially discussed. Key details, such as what information to capture and how it will be integrated, need to be defined. It was mentioned that Dan might investigate this.
> 3. The process for handling manager-level overrides for discounts was mentioned but not detailed. The specific authorization and logging requirements need to be specified.
> 4. The specific location and method for storing ancillary data related to violations (e.g., court codes, case numbers) were identified as a need but not resolved.
