Speaker 1 00:00:02
I started to. I am trying to figure out what states are buying what. Yeah, priority.
Speaker 2 00:00:10
That's outside of like so pigeonholed into this stuff that I couldn't even tell you. So caveat, I just got access to Louisiana system that has all the state data. Okay, uh just got me just got an email this morning.
Speaker 2 00:00:31
Giving my username and password, it'll take at least one business day. But anywho, I got enough to try and talk you through it. So what I received at first was this. So Ian is like in charge of like our back end technology. He did this initial research.
Speaker 2 00:01:02
And he went through, I am trying to get access to, pull this stuff out. So. 
Speaker 1 00:01:08
This is their current process or. 
Speaker 2 00:01:10
This is their current fee structure. Okay. So what we're thinking of doing, what we want to do is so like this is a whole bunch of different stuff and condense it down to something that makes a lot more sense. Um and. 
Speaker 1 00:01:27
Can I ask so once we have the fees and the, You know, percentages and all the numbers. That is going to be running the what we just saw this morning for the checkout card. It's going to be feeding into that. Okay,
Speaker 2 00:01:40
So what I did was I took that mess of stuff and broke it down this way. So we're giving everything a skew, so everything's going to have a number. We've got our fee amounts; sometimes they're broken up over different things or whatever. Got a couple questions in here but laid it all out because this makes a lot more sense. Sure, So this is for right now everything we're going to charge for and then the other side of it is where we put them into process. So he also did this. Here's the mural, yeah. So this is uh what he did. So the way I'm thinking about it is um breaking it out by like the license type.
Speaker 2 00:02:30
So like we got class A B and C, class D, E. All this stuff right? So there's different things. But this is like kind of the flow that it would be going through. So E is like a typical license. So we'll start here. Are they both no? Yeah I don't know why they both no that doesn't make sense to me. Oh because it's either one of these things. It's a funny way to do that but essentially like is it new or, Renew, or is it an update to a current? And it kind of goes through. So this lays on top of what we're currently doing. So what I'm trying to do is take these, lay it on top of what we got, and then fit in these lookups for that skew into it. And then this lookup and the skew and that number is what's going to pop into the cart.
Speaker 1 00:03:27
So the front like, Think about the front end logic. The front end is going to be the cart.
Speaker 2 00:03:33
The front end is going to be the cart. The front end is going to be, you know, going through like I want to renew my license or type in clicks. And on the back end it's like this series of logic checks like what are they actually doing? What do they want to do? Pulling out the fees.
Speaker 1 00:03:53
Is you had SKUs listed out? Is that. 
Speaker 1 00:03:59
I didn't. I know this is specific right now to Louisiana. Are you accounting for fees for other states?
Speaker 2 00:04:05
Yeah, so what I think the origin was West Virginia. I'd like to do my thought process is we'll list all these out and I'll kind of add to the end we'll put like LA on all these so some of them are specific right like Orleans, nobody else is going to have that but I think we can do. 
Speaker 1 00:04:29
That's exactly where my mind was. That was like some of them will prepend or yeah,
Speaker 2 00:04:34
And there's very yeah, I think right here one through at the end, but either yeah, it's either pre or at the end. So because we can't keep a lot of these the same, I think what's going to get iffy is we can keep some of these cues the same with just changing that prepend to it. But every state's going to have to have its own like, Table, because all those amounts are going to change.
Speaker 1 00:05:01
Right, yeah.
Speaker 2 00:05:02
Based on the state. Um. And at that point, aren't they just separate SKUs? That's where I'm kind of like on the fence, and I got to talk to them where it's like is it even worth it? Because like what's going to be the same? And like the other thing that's confusing is how sometimes it's like other states don't do class, right class is the same way. So like Yeah.
Speaker 1 00:05:25
Is there almost like a. 
Speaker 1 00:05:28
A skew group. Probably. I think that goes against the skew concept.
Speaker 2 00:05:34
Because it'd be like, a group like personal driver's license, we could do like a temporary group of commercial.
Speaker 1 00:05:40
Oh, I was thinking grouped by state. Oh yeah, we could do it that way. I don't know, and I'm just brainstorming here as I cause that would be almost like, I think it would be a safe assumption that none of these are going to be the same. And if they were, it would be, Let's let's us be opinionated and say they're not like.
Speaker 2 00:06:01
I don't know, take that step. Yeah, it's so I am still early on in this process. Um, yeah, trying to make sense of it, trying to figure out how it all fits in because then like t here is some other like wrinkles to this where uh we touched on it briefly this morning. T here is discounts worked into thisum so. 
Speaker 1 00:06:24
Can I ask when you, That Miro you showed me. Yeah, yeah. Is that just essentially how to add up all of the relevant.
Speaker 2 00:06:34
Excuse me. Pretty much it's like a combination of how to add them up and what the system is looking at to get to how to add them up so. It's it's like a weird mix is what he did because like this new kind of, You're gonna have to know that to be able to figure out like what schemes fall under it. But this part's not really. It's like needed, but it doesn't have anything to do with this. You know what I mean? Like the skew for this doesn't really care whether it's a new issue or a renew. It's just looking for this. 
Speaker 1 00:07:17
Specific thing, but that does add that will increment differently. Yeah. 
Speaker 2 00:07:26
So, thisum trying to unwind this is where I am at. Yeah.
Speaker 1 00:07:34
But essentially, I mean that is when you are talking about the fee structure. When someone goes through this process, are they going to be listing out and I guess that's where I wasn't, I couldn't really see the You are going to see which skew is in the cart, is that right? Or are you just seeing the final?
Speaker 2 00:07:52
So you'll see your initial thought. Here is your fee. Versus, here is a fee where you have like an overarching fee. You can kind of break it down a little bit, but it's not going to say like license renewal class E over seventy six years term.
Speaker 1 00:08:16
License fee, yeah,
Speaker 2 00:08:18
It's just going to say. 
Speaker 1 00:08:19
Your license fee that twenty twenty five is accounting for your under seventy. Is accounting for that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2 00:08:26
So we're shorthanding some of it.'Cause we're doing the calculation on the back end.
Speaker 1 00:08:32
Ooh, I like seeing the data. Yeah,
Speaker 2 00:08:35
I didn't do these. Um, I can't take credit for that one, but that was in one of... But this was his like. 
Speaker 1 00:08:43
Playing around with it. Yeah. Okay, so this is essentially the engine that is informing the cart how much to you know how much to charge? Okay.
Speaker 2 00:08:55
So, I'll be working really close with engineering on this because this is outside of my area of expertise. Yeah,
Speaker 1 00:09:03
And your primary like your primary motive is adding up and displaying the fees. Correct. Yeah, okay. Based on their current rates. Got it. Yeah. Hmm. 
Speaker 2 00:09:17
So it's a lot of backend work? Sure Um There's some more types of, But as far as like what's actually like going to be in the tickets, it's yeah.
Speaker 1 00:09:27
I wonder if you can inform Cade of the descriptions of each of the fees and then just describe the person or the license and just let it do it. Well, it's maybe non- deterministic.
Speaker 2 00:09:40
Yeah, uh, I don'tum... The reason is we're using it, but I don't know why.
Speaker 1 00:09:53
Can I have access to this? Absolutely. Yeah,
Speaker 2 00:10:02
Can you like export it? True, what I am saying is okay.
Speaker 1 00:10:14
Yeah, because I am interested whenever you end up talking about the skew. I am interested to talk about scaling this, making sure that that's just accounted for.
Speaker 2 00:10:28
Yeah, so the way that my timeline works based on the other work of teams doing is. You are at a hotel. No talking to Tony about it. Oh oh oh, not sorryum.
Speaker 2 00:10:49
Middle of end of next week, I'll be doing open a pull product and design to do like a little bit of light thing around this. So I'll make sure you got an invite to that. And then probably, it's kind of weird because I can't really get engineers involved until they finish all this stuff by February twenty third. So I won't really be able to bring them in until the middle of February. So the team that I would use for this is the team that's working on all this stuff for UAT. We talked about this morning. Got it,
Speaker 1 00:11:20
The cart.
Speaker 2 00:11:21
The cart, yes. So I need them to finish that for this hard deadline. I can't get them started on this until they finish that. But. 
Speaker 1 00:11:31
There wouldn't be, and correct me if I'm wrong, there wouldn't be UI work with this? You just need the backend guys to do stuff? Okay.
Speaker 2 00:11:39
For U eighteen, this for that February twenty third date, this stuff's not part of it? Yes. So we're just mocking the prices in the cart? Yep. 
Speaker 2 00:11:50
Awesome. So, somewhere in the middle of February, I'll bring it over. But we started with no products. Probably get through this. Okay. I'll make sure you get involved.
Speaker 1 00:12:02
Yeah, I would love access to that because there's a lot of good...
Speaker 2 00:12:06
I'll ping him, I'll get you access to this and then I'm going to be putting this other spreadsheet into Confluence which we have access to Oh yeah Oh the. 
Speaker 1 00:12:14
Actual fees Yeah Cool, Yeah. So that's that's what I'm working on. All right. Yeah, let me know how I can help. I think that's super interesting. Um, I was starting to think of how reusable that cart component could be. Yes. And then it seems like this is just a logical connection extension,
Speaker 2 00:12:35
Yeah? Yeah, because I think the the thought process for us is to make this reusable components because you really don't have a cart without this now No otherwise it's just like a. 
Speaker 1 00:12:46
It's just demos basically, Maybe that's what you like. Maybe that's what they're.
Speaker 2 00:12:50
I don't know, but yeah, like this is what makes that go. Yeah, I do think the more I look at it as far as like the SKUs and the tables and stuff, we're just going to have to have a fee set for every state separately.
Speaker 1 00:13:05
I personally like that. I mean, I think it'll how many do you have a total count of fees for at least Louisiana?
Speaker 2 00:13:13
Yeah, so generally speaking.
Speaker 2 00:13:23
Thirty six. No, what are those? Fifty. 
Speaker 1 00:13:35
Fifty one. A potential yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Oh, is that how that works? Each one of these is a separate database. Well, I don't know. I don't know how to do any of this. Okay okay okay. I was just thinking from a SKU perspective, but really each state only cares about their SKUs. Yeah,
Speaker 2 00:14:00
I think you could put it on the same place. Yeah, so it wouldn't matter because you can just stack it all. Especially. 
Speaker 1 00:14:06
If you have that delineation between...
Speaker 2 00:14:08
Yeah, as long as you're identifying that's what it is, it wouldn't matter if they were all in the same spot.
Speaker 1 00:14:12
IDs OOS for LA. That's a good point anyway. Yeah, I agree with that idea. Sweet okay this was helpful cool especially yeah. 
Speaker 2 00:14:23
So, I'll like I said, I am going to take a look at what's going on.
Speaker 1 00:14:27
Cool, yeah, I appreciate it. This is a fun one. This I can grab onto this.

## 1. State-Specific Fee SKUs and Cart Integration
### Conclusion
Fees will be modeled as SKUs and integrated into the backend engine that informs cart totals. Each state will maintain its own fee set/table, and the cart will display shorthand fee descriptions instead of verbose SKU details. Louisiana is the current focus, with other states to follow. Engineering engagement will begin after the February 23 hard deadline for cart/UAT work.
### Plan
- [ ] Define Louisiana fee SKUs and amounts, including discounts and edge cases; load into a structured table and Confluence -- [Speaker 2]  [Middle of end of next week]
- [ ] Share Miro flow and fee spreadsheets with Tyler; provide access/export -- [Speaker 2]
- [ ] Schedule and run a product/design review session to validate the SKU model and fee display behavior -- [Speaker 2] Tyler [Middle of end of next week]
- [ ] After cart/UAT completion (post-Feb 23), engage engineering to implement backend logic checks and SKU-based fee lookup for Louisiana -- [Speaker 2] Engineering team [February twenty third]
- [ ] Mock prices in the cart for UAT prior to backend implementation -- [Speaker 2] Engineering team
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 2]: Each state should have its own fee set/table because amounts vary; reusing exact SKUs across states is impractical
   - Differences like Orleans-specific fees in LA; other states use different class schemas
   - Considering prepend/append state codes to SKUs (e.g., LA) but still treating states as distinct sets
2. [Tyler]: Favors separating fee sets by state to simplify scaling and ownership
   - Notes that each state only cares about its own SKUs; a shared store is fine if clearly delineated (e.g., IDs OOS for LA)
3. [Speaker 2]: Current fee data for Louisiana exists; initial access to the Louisiana state system was just granted and may take at least one business day to become fully active
   - Received username/password email this morning; access activation delay: at least one business day
   - Ian conducted initial backend research and produced a Miro flow
4. [Tyler]: The front end should act as the cart; the backend runs logic checks to determine applicable fees
5. [Speaker 2]: Fees will be shorthanded in the cart; the backend calculates details (e.g., license type, renew/new, age brackets)
   - Example: the cart shows “License fee” with year and implicit conditions (under seventy), not verbose “license renewal class E over seventy six years term”
6. [Tyler]: Wants access to the Miro and spreadsheets; interested in SKU scaling strategy and reuse of the cart component across products/states
7. [Speaker 2]: Timeline constraints prevent engineering involvement until after the Feb 23 hard deadline for cart/UAT; will do light product/design work “middle of end of next week”
   - The same engineering team working on UAT/cart will later implement the SKU/fee engine
8. [Tyler]: Confirms no new UI needed for Feb 23; prices will be mocked in the cart
9. [Speaker 2]: Considering SKU grouping ideas, but grouping by state is more realistic; discounts exist and add complexity
   - Miro combines “what the system looks at” with “how to add up fees”; some flows (new vs renew) influence increments but SKU lookup focuses on specific attributes
## 2. SKU Structure, Naming, and Grouping Strategy
### Conclusion
The team is leaning toward state-based SKU sets with state-coded identifiers and avoiding cross-state SKU reuse. Grouping by state is acceptable; grouping by product type is less aligned with the SKU concept given state variance. The team will be opinionated that SKUs are state-differentiated to prevent ambiguity.
### Discussion Points
1. [Tyler]: Prefers an opinionated stance that SKUs are not shared across states; group by state to avoid mismatches
2. [Speaker 2]: State-code in the SKU (prepend/append) is workable, but practical differences mean they are effectively separate SKUs per state
   - Other states may not use the same class structure (A/B/C/D/E), complicating reuse
3. [Tyler]: Considers maintainability in a single repository if state delineation is explicit
4. [Speaker 2]: Open questions remain on whether any SKU grouping beyond state is beneficial; discounts and special cases complicate grouping
## 3. Data Access, Artifacts, and Collaboration Workflow
### Conclusion
Speaker 2 will share the Miro flow and fee spreadsheets with Tyler and publish the structured fee table to Confluence. A product/design review will be scheduled “middle of end of next week,” and engineering will be engaged mid-February post-Feb 23. Tyler will participate in scaling discussions.
### Plan
- [ ] Export/share Miro and spreadsheets to Tyler -- [Speaker 2] Tyler
- [ ] Publish the fee table to Confluence (Louisiana first) -- [Speaker 2]
- [ ] Invite Tyler to the product/design review to cover SKU schema and cart display -- [Speaker 2] Tyler [Middle of end of next week]
- [ ] Engage engineering post-Feb 23 to implement the backend engine and integrate with the cart -- [Speaker 2] Engineering team [February twenty third]
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 2]: Miro shows the flow of determining fees and logic checks; will collaborate closely with engineering as this is outside their core expertise
2. [Tyler]: Requests access to Miro/fees; wants to discuss SKU scaling and reuse
3. [Speaker 2]: Confluence will host the finalized fee tables; Louisiana access is pending (at least one business day)
## 4. Cart/UAT Milestone and Interim Approach
### Conclusion
For the February 23 UAT deadline, the cart will use mocked prices with no new UI scope added. The backend fee engine integration begins after the UAT/cart work completes.
### Plan
- [ ] Complete the UAT cart by Feb 23 with mocked pricing -- Engineering team [February twenty third]
- [ ] Post-UAT, start integrating the backend fee engine and the Louisiana fee set -- Engineering team [February twenty third]
### Discussion Points
1. [Tyler]: Confirms no UI work needed now; backend will come later
2. [Speaker 2]: Cannot bring engineers in until cart/UAT work completes by Feb 23; will start mid-February
> AI Suggestions
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. SKU naming convention and schema standard: The exact SKU format (state prepend vs append, field order, allowed characters) and a canonical schema (required attributes like state, license type/class, action: new/renew/update, age bracket, term) were not finalized. Define a formal naming and metadata standard to prevent fragmentation across states and ensure consistent lookups.
> 2. Discount handling specification: Discounts were mentioned but not defined. Clarify discount types (e.g., age-based, renewal timing, residency), eligibility logic, stacking rules, and how discounts map to SKUs or separate rules tables. Decide whether discounts are separate SKUs, modifiers, or rule-based calculations.
> 3. Miro-to-implementation mapping: The Miro flow “mixes” eligibility logic and fee summation. Create a clear separation-of-concerns document: which attributes feed SKU selection vs which influence quantity/amount modifiers, and define the rule engine interface the backend will implement.
> 4. Cross-state data model governance: While each state will have its own fee table, a shared data model and validation rules were not defined. Establish governance for adding states (templates, required fields, validation scripts, versioning, and state code registry) to reduce future onboarding risk.
> 5. Access and artifact delivery dates: Access sharing to Miro/Confluence and the exact date/time for the product/design review are not specified. Set explicit dates to avoid delays, and confirm when Louisiana system access is fully active (post “at least one business day”).
