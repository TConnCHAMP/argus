Transcript from2026-01-26T15:59:00Z
Speaker 1 00:00:00
right on the bridge i feel like being in this building makes me question my normally great.
Speaker 2 00:00:08
directional awareness and i get in here and i'm like i don't know if it works for those windows.
Speaker 1 00:00:14
right by me i would have said there's like my window looks at this and i'm like i don't know.
Speaker 3 00:00:18
what this is yeah this is sweet informational data so how's your first week good there's a.
Speaker 1 00:00:40
lot it's yeah it's quite the quite the whirlwind okay so the thing you said to me like wednesday is like a thing i thought within my first week i'm like i basically do all this yeah there's a flavor, I don't know where they've been or how much of the vision of HXP that I knew of ever came to fruition. But I know for a fact, from a general platform, and then you build solutions, it's like it had all of it.
Speaker 2 00:01:10
I should have brought my laptop, yeah. Do you want to go get it? I built a FEP solution I was talking about. Automate, New Year Highland Automate. That's what I built. And it's for the engines or the reusability. These flows, the whiteboard of a flow, you can plug into this automate process.
Speaker 1 00:01:35
And it'll spin out.
Speaker 2 00:01:36
Yeah, but then you can take that automate process and plug it into a front end. And it's an API. I'm working on it. It's not done yet.
Speaker 1 00:01:48
Because it's like... We don't have the exact same business problems to solve that OnBase does in the, like, every flavors of reputation of every industry of every generic, generic. Like, we don't have that. We have 51 jurisdictions. Yes. Like, it is a finite, finite number. Now, look.
Speaker 2 00:02:11
But each of those I'm just looking at, I just learned about, like, the fees engine and all of that. You say it's just 51 jurisdictions, but if you look at the SKUs associated with...
Speaker 1 00:02:23
And so this is where I don't know. Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:02:24
You look at the SKUs associated with Louisiana and just basic fees, one small part of Louisiana, there's 65 different permutations of a fee. And, yeah, I think...
Speaker 1 00:02:39
Like, fees engine might need to be a bit more generic, but it's like, we don't need, like, a generic, generic workflow builder.
Speaker 3 00:02:45
Right.
Speaker 1 00:02:46
Like, there are, like, document types. We know what those are. Or, like, the things that flow through the workflow themselves, I mean, now, yeah. But I'll say yes or no, because if the document type is a credential, like Louisiana's credential, it's going to be different than Florida's in a number of ways. Like, the way they think about violations, or the way they think about, you know, so it's like, so there is a bit of that, like, document, and then, like, keywords. Right. Keyword types.
Speaker 2 00:03:14
They should be state-configured document type.
Speaker 3 00:03:18
Yes.
Speaker 2 00:03:19
Like, yes, it's a credential, but it's a Louisiana credential.
Speaker 3 00:03:29
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:03:29
And I've almost seen, at least, and I forget if I mentioned this to you, like, there's like two paths of configuration that I'm seeing a need for. The, I'll call it that, on-basis, then the process scalability.
Speaker 3 00:03:46
Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2 00:03:47
Because right now, they're hardcoding. We'll talk, I'm going to fall back on that piece, actually, because that's the only thing I know. They're, like, hardcoding that. And then they do that for Louisiana, and then they have to do that for Kentucky. Like, that needs to be more plug-and-play. And I don't want to say more dumbed-down, but something that these activation teams can go and just do. Use. Yeah. And so that second piece is what I've been just...
Speaker 1 00:04:20
Because it's, like, I feel like I don't even... I can't... I'm having such a hard time wraPPIng my head around where we need to go. Because I'm just stuck on what we're doing and being like, I don't know how... Someone does, like, architecture and Kevin, and I'm like, I don't know why we thought...
Speaker 2 00:04:43
um so i actually just got off a call with carrie okay yeah awesome yeah i'm DMing yeah she just gave me a ton of information and charts i have architectural diagrams yeah if you're not on like there is an architecture site yeah i had to like sign into it yeah yeah i want to take that and put.
Speaker 1 00:05:01
in an ai but i feel like that's frowned upon oh just download it i can get you back i can get, api i've been using my personal i think as long as it's not ip like some it's like some things it's like you could ask your personal for like go find me public information right but we shouldn't be uploading architectural diagrams because yes because the personal licensing is different than the corporate or anthropic so if you haven't like unchecked the box as an example that says you can.
Speaker 1 00:05:36
use this stuff as your questions as training you know what i mean like just that type of thing. by, Yeah, there's a corporate version. I can get to a corporate, like, now it's not the chat cloud, it's just the cloud code in Terminal.
Speaker 2 00:05:48
Yeah, and I can just let it run all night.
Speaker 1 00:05:51
I mean, I'll set you like a PPI restriction limit. You want to get like Gastown going, because that's not the thing the kids are talking about these days is Gastown.
Speaker 2 00:05:59
No, what is it? I'm thinking about Cloudbot. Have you seen Cloudbot? I think, no. You give it access to your whole computer and it just does.
Speaker 1 00:06:12
Oh, like the co-worker thing. 
Speaker 2 00:06:13
Yeah, it's wild. But it costs, it comes up to like hundreds of dollars. Oh yeah, yeah. I typically burn through my tokens within an hour or two.
Speaker 1 00:06:26
I feel like I've gotten better at like managing my, something I'm not spending more than $20 a month on this. Yeah. But, yeah. So, the... Part of the problem, I think, has been, or part of where the architecture has been edging, because we don't have enough product requirements, is where, like, the thing I think you can help with, potentially, assuming the product requirements are out there somewhere, right, so, it's like, we don't, yeah, it's like, well, we don't, you know, like, 51 jurisdictions, we don't have all of the flows and requirements for all of those 51 jurisdictions mapped in a place to say, okay, this is the least common denominator, these are the assumptions we can make, these are the extension points.
Speaker 1 00:07:11
And so what that means is that, like, some, like, you end up deferring to what happens in a state plugin because they just, they don't know, you don't know across states if it needs to be core or not, and so things like, you know, what are the credential types, or the vehicle classes for a state, it's like, well, that's... hard-coded in an enum that we literally migrate into the database, and so if anything has to change, you add something to that enum, and you can migrate, like, deploy and migrate the database, so, like, now this new thing is injected.
Speaker 2 00:07:46
And the only, I mean, there isn't a database upgrade. They don't have to perform an upgrade on their side. We perform the upgrades. We're doing it. We're doing it. But you still need that. I see the value in avoiding that.
Speaker 1 00:07:59
Yeah. Or, I mean, the way, it's like, so, here's what I've been trying to sell, because when I first started asking questions, I ruffled some architecture feathers. I haven't figured out how to not ruffle those feathers. But, and so what I'm doing is, like, in the meantime, getting buy-in directionally. And so things like, you know, can state deploy, can state make a change, state delivery make a change without any coordination with the product team. 
Speaker 3 00:08:29
it's like today the answer is no do you want that to be true right like you know that's exactly.
Speaker 1 00:08:33
what i'm just an example it's like all right new fee thing for kentucky i don't want to have to care right and i want them to be able to do that and i don't want them to deal with release like like life cycle release pipelines any of that stuff they should be able to do that so i just.
Speaker 2 00:08:48
i was just talking with abby that's why i was late here my thought behind that was almost like let's launch it or like build it so that with our internal users in mind whoever's doing that today who does that today who would go and add a SKU engineering scrambling for resources yes someone would contact us sales or they would contact us that comes to a meeting it's like hey somebody.
Speaker 1 00:09:15
does work yeah i guess uh we'll put it over here here's your ticket for it but imagine if.
Speaker 2 00:09:22
someone from tabitha's team could just go in there and do that in an interface, And it goes back to that BPMN process, but also at that configuration level, too.
Speaker 1 00:09:31
Yes, yes. And I feel like I've gotten, like, obviously the pure ops side of the house, we're not trying to be like, like, in terms of, like, OnBase, like, deployment models, like, we're multi-instance, much like OnBase. That's fine. They're going to have to, like, that's fine. We don't need to pretend that we have a multi-tenant. Like, the overhead of trying to pretend like that's multi-tenant is not worth it. Fine. Multi-instance. There's not going to be 20,000 instances. There's going to be 51. But it's, like, that's, you know, like, fine.
Speaker 1 00:10:02
Like, that is, like, when that number can be finite, great. Works perfect. Different requirements, different compliance. Some might care about GovCloud, all that. You know what I mean? Like, fine, we can support it. But the administration ownership of the solution, where even once we deploy, like, say, Kansas or whatever. Kansas, and then they, somebody passes a law, and now there's a new fee kind, and wiring that.
Speaker 1 00:10:32
Like, it's an unresolved question of, like, who does that work once we've got the initial, solution deployed. Right.
Speaker 2 00:10:41
Who maintains it.
Speaker 1 00:10:44
And because of how much is in the plans, it's like, why do we need people, like, we don't have to have staff dev teams for states, ultimately, this is what, like, I don't know how we, in the current architecture, I don't know how we get away from that.
Speaker 2 00:10:58
And it's, like, so the new concept to me is that it's all contract.
Speaker 1 00:11:03
It is very contract-based, which also. And those contracts expire? Yeah, I think they expire. They're like 10-year contracts or something like that? I don't know enough, but I know that there's, like, a few different contracting models. Like, for example, we're in West Virginia, but we just, like, replied RFP, like, submitted RFP for the credentials out of the house. Like, we're there for vehicles, but we're not there for our credentials.
Speaker 2 00:11:34
It's, like, a different product.
Speaker 1 00:11:35
It's a different product. But, like, if we, let's say, we lose that bid, like, what does, like, there's such a connection to customer and vehicle that, like, I don't actually know what happens if we lose that bid in terms of, like, does that mean the whole thing is replaced or is there a different RF? Like, this part is new and I don't have my head wrapped around it. We are, but it is new in a way that impacts our decision making, like, you know, in a way that I also don't understand. You know what I mean. 
Speaker 2 00:12:02
So that was actually a big shtick of mine when I was at, with my product at Highland. I was a reg chat bot. Who today can't build a reg chat bot with their documents? And so our big thing was they're already Highland customers. You already have your documents in OnBase. just add on add our thing on now we went head to head with many different options homegrown tyler tech you know how we partnered with them they tried to build better than me it almost.
Speaker 2 00:12:35
seems like that's the same thing like you'll have the most seamless experience if you go with our new credentialing but you don't have to like it behooves you is that the word to come with us yeah.
Speaker 1 00:12:49
yeah and like i also don't know then what that means for like for example so like you've caught on i hope you caught on by now that like what we have in west virginia is different yes is, like they talk about it's like gen one vitas yes okay can i upgrade them to gen two vitas if the solution stays the same without a contract like that like i don't know.
Speaker 2 00:13:14
Without a contract, is the, yeah.
Speaker 1 00:13:16
Like, because if it's, I mean, we can deploy their software without a contract, so it's like, like, there is an expectation of continuous improvements to some degree. Jesus Christ. Yeah, no. But, like, I don't, I don't know.
Speaker 2 00:13:39
VTOS Gen 2, I was just talking, because that will also be deployed on the universal data model.
Speaker 1 00:13:45
Yes, yes.
Speaker 2 00:13:48
Do we just want to upgrade that? I assume we don't want to do it for free.
Speaker 1 00:13:52
It's like, it's in our best interest to upgrade them, because, like, for example, for MyDMVGov, which is, you know, as a citizen, I can do my shit. Like, doing that for West Virginia first means that VTOS Gen 1 has to do it. But that means that VTOS Gen 2, like, like, you have... they're just two versions they're two separate code bases they're two separate sets of functionality when do you rip the band-aid off when do you rip the band-aid off and how much work is there to be able to like rip the band-aid because vitas gen 2 today.
Speaker 1 00:14:27
exists only for rhode island and i thought it was that was a west virginia thing no and we haven't gone live with rhode island yet so nobody has like it's still no one has gen one one vitas right no gen one vitas is what's in west virginia and kentucky and.
Speaker 2 00:14:49
you were saying gen two again two vitas i didn't think.
Speaker 1 00:14:52
that that was a thing yet it's what Rhode island will use right but.
Speaker 2 00:14:56
it doesn't technically exist yet it exists it's not.
Speaker 1 00:14:60
been deployed like it's not introduction use but it exists like you're trying to launch yeah.
Speaker 2 00:15:07
And that does use the universe data model already.
Speaker 1 00:15:09
And that uses UADM, but there's like this problem that like I think Kevin's got back to me. Like they're in a release branch. So UADM has like a repository, is like forked, like is all happening over here for Louisiana, and then there's a release branch for Rhode Island. Now Rhode Island doesn't need any of the credential stuff, which is most of the work that's happening for UADM right now for Louisiana. Right. And so it's giving me anxiety because it's like, yeah, they're literally two different code branches.
Speaker 1 00:15:39
And they've not been merged together yet. Aren't they the same though? They had the same origin point from four months ago, something. I don't know when the last time was.
Speaker 2 00:15:49
Yeah, I can see where that's problematic.
Speaker 1 00:15:53
It's like imagine building OBS, but you build the work, like Rhode Island needs workflow, and Louisiana needs, I don't know, intelligent capture. Yeah. Okay, there's some shared stuff. They build the documents. But then, like, this is all for them, and then this all is for them, but neither, nothing has been deployed in prod yet, and so, for the Louisiana side of the house, like, yeah, I don't know why nobody's replying to me about why this isn't.
Speaker 2 00:16:23
I actually am supposed to make a video, I think. I don't like not having my work email with me on the go, but I also kind of really like it. When I'm on, I want it, but when I leave, I don't.
Speaker 1 00:16:36
I just use the, like, Outlook app. The web portal? Not that it works. On your personal? Yeah. Kind of like, I don't know that. Just that one, but it doesn't, it's not, like, integrated, like, your calendar's not integrated. Yeah, you have to go there. Which gives me the nice thing, it's, like, separate, but I can go look. Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:16:58
Yeah, I'm supposed to be using it. With Kevin? Yeah. I've just been scheduling meetings with people to like...
Speaker 3 00:17:05
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's good. Where are you at. 
Speaker 2 00:17:08
What's...
Speaker 3 00:17:09
Yeah. So...
Speaker 1 00:17:10
Is there something about queues that like... I don't understand. Like the way we use the word queues confuses me.
Speaker 2 00:17:20
So Abby was just saying the term queue as like the actual wait, like the line at the DMV.
Speaker 1 00:17:30
Uh huh.
Speaker 2 00:17:31
That's something that...
Speaker 1 00:17:32
This is more queue, like workflow queue.
Speaker 2 00:17:34
Okay.
Speaker 1 00:17:35
Like how many things are in the status and what needs to be done to move them to the next status. It's like the statuses are the queues. And...
Speaker 2 00:17:46
Not a new product.
Speaker 1 00:17:48
No. Existing. Like right now, the way that... Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:17:53
So, like, the RabbitMQ. 
Speaker 1 00:17:54
Yeah, I think they're literally RabbitMQ queues. But because we don't have... Like, you know how Workflow had the, like, routing and people and different? We don't have any of that, which means people log in and there's an inbox of queues. They go to one, they get ten records, in some cases. They get, like, ten records. Nobody else gets those ten records. And I think those ten records maybe even, like, move. I don't know. Like, I don't know. Like, it's things like...
Speaker 2 00:18:19
I don't think that... I think it's all manual, though. I think it's all manually hard-coded queues. Yes, yes, yes. But that's where I think Workflow is the type of people.
Speaker 1 00:18:28
But we're conflating RabbitMQ queues to queues of work to queues for a person. Like, that all is, like, a conflated... Sometimes when somebody says queue, they mean one of those three. There's probably 200 buckets I'm missing. Right.
Speaker 2 00:18:43
Well, and then there's the product queue that we want to take, because then it can actually track a person as soon as they come into the office. to the timeline. So then there's a third, it's the actual productized UI version of it.
Speaker 3 00:19:04
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:19:05
Are you tuned in with anything, Cade. 
Speaker 1 00:19:07
I'm getting tuned in. Okay. Yeah. Like this is actually another example. Like somebody pinged me like, oh, I'm waiting resources for VTAS Gen 1 for Cade. I'm like, yeah, you and everybody. Even though West Virginia's in running mode, we're still doing a whole lot of product development.
Speaker 2 00:19:25
I would love to be, I haven't talked with Abby about this, but like from what I'm seeing with their idea, their document processing, there's a lot, I think there's some things that we could prototype out to improve the quality. I just don't want to, I brought it up to the one architect guy and he. 
Speaker 3 00:19:46
Justin. 
Speaker 2 00:19:47
No, I don't know if he's architect.
Speaker 3 00:19:48
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:19:49
Nate? And he seemed to have ideas or plans. I didn't get to finish the conversation.
Speaker 1 00:19:56
Yeah, okay. Yeah, actually, this week I'm going to be deep diving with Nate. Okay. On, like, show me the code. Oh, yeah. Show me the decisions. Show me the business rules.
Speaker 2 00:20:06
Because that's another place that we built out an AI agent builder. Mm-hmm. But it wasn't, it allowed us to quickly craft with custom rules in plain English. And I think that that would also be beneficial here. Because I think what he's doing is just building out handcrafted agents, system prompts.
Speaker 3 00:20:29
Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2 00:20:30
But they're specific for their hard coding.
Speaker 1 00:20:35
Yeah. Yes. That one, I'll say I have, like, I have less anxiety about that one. A, because, like, the... So, a lot of this is, I don't know how self-service down to the people of the, at the DMVs, any of this needs to be. It's like, versus enabling just our implementation people, right, where it's like, if that, if K8 is as isolated as it, like currently it's like Python, and we're using the strands, like AWS strands framework, and most of the back and forth, it's like the, are hidden in the business rules, not, I mean there has been some.
Speaker 2 00:21:20
I'll say this too, if we're not converting or extracting Markdown, and passing that alongside the document, when we ask for the extraction, we shouldn't be. But I think that's out of my wheelhouse. I don't think that that recommends for me per se, so.
Speaker 1 00:21:43
Yeah. Nate, do you want to just come. 
Speaker 2 00:21:45
I would love more information on the K8 offering.
Speaker 1 00:21:49
Because Nate is, like, a pretty ambidextrous person. He's got product back, like, he's got product stuff before he's got leadership stuff.
Speaker 2 00:21:57
Yeah.
Speaker 1 00:21:57
I don't know how tuned in to the, like, latest and greatest of agent stuff is.
Speaker 2 00:22:04
And I think I only, because that's what I've been doing for the last two years.
Speaker 1 00:22:07
Yeah, and I am even, I am from a different, like, MCP, like, I built an MCP server.
Speaker 3 00:22:14
Right.
Speaker 1 00:22:14
And that was enough. It was like, oh, and that worked. And then you can build agents on top, I suppose, but we didn't even, like, need to do that. It was just the MCP server was, like, all the way there.
Speaker 2 00:22:23
Yeah.
Speaker 1 00:22:24
Yeah, and things like evals were, like.
Speaker 2 00:22:27
There's a whole platform we could be using. There's open, so how much open source utilities are we using for evaluations. 
Speaker 3 00:22:33
No.
Speaker 2 00:22:34
And I brought that up to him, and he was like, well, it has to run in Bedrock. Which I don't necessarily agree with, like. I think what's the framework you're thinking um the one that it just spurred our conversation I didn't recommend yeah but it was um Kaggle came out with like an evaluation platform and it was like oh for like little side data sets but the concept of being able to have this third-party utility you plug in your own models sure you want to use your bedrock models yeah they could be the.
Speaker 2 00:23:06
judge and the executioner you know but I would love yeah if there is any if there's any cade aid calls I would love to be yeah Abby seemed to have some good priorities for me short term or at least now but I'm trying to just absorb yeah here this is like a follow-up for my so.
Speaker 1 00:23:28
what's the roadmap for the next few months what are the hiring needs where does K8 live relative to other services and then deeper down the K8s as far as this to you um yeah okay what else you got, Are you really stuck. 
Speaker 2 00:23:45
Did your car get stuck. 
Speaker 1 00:23:47
Probably. I was stuck and then I got out and then I did not find a better place to park so I parked at the same spot. I was thinking like, if I'm in the same, I got out. So...
Speaker 2 00:23:58
I think we got Courtney's car stuck in our driveway so it's still sitting there. I'm trying to think what I just learned. PIM, there's this concept of PIM. I don't know what that acronym stands for yet. Abby just brought it up to me. I don't know how important that is. She seemed to think it's very important.
Speaker 1 00:24:19
Well, I think it's because there's like a relationship between PIM and fees because some things that are tracked need to be paid for. That's where those things are getting grouped.
Speaker 2 00:24:28
Yeah. Where does, in fall with you. 
Speaker 1 00:24:33
So in... Runs state delivery and activation.
Speaker 2 00:24:38
Okay.
Speaker 1 00:24:38
So.
Speaker 2 00:24:39
But he's VP of, his title says VP of product engineering. 
Speaker 1 00:24:43
No, it's not anymore.
Speaker 2 00:24:44
Okay.
Speaker 1 00:24:44
So the history is that Darren ran all of engineering. Like, basically had my job. He was director. Everybody reported to him directly. And then Isaac and in were state delivery. And so, like, as an example, Isaac right now in Louisiana is working on implementing, like, all of Louisiana's integrations.
Speaker 2 00:25:06
Specific integrations.
Speaker 1 00:25:08
And then the product team is handling everything else. The idea would be when we onboard a new state or we roll out new features. Maybe just, maybe I don't, the roll out new features is the part I have the most question about. But, like, onboarding a new state. you know for example in Louisiana we're putting together like a training like LMS system and training and videos and so it's like in's doing all of that in activation plus the state-specific thing and so the goal would be if UADM and these Gen 2 VITAS and you know all that shit was done well enough then in could go on board two states and just be off to the races only where there's new functionality needed.
Speaker 1 00:25:57
where there need to be something put on the road map but if it's just taking advantage of existing stuff he's consuming the platform instead of trying to build out the last one SS yes no problem is like him consuming the platform right now is like co-located code with the platform's platform sure it's like folders and shit yeah like my I mean he was originally it's like the folder for the LA the folder for this I'm like can we get, I would love it, because there will be custom code.
Speaker 1 00:26:30
It's not like zero custom code is the goal.
Speaker 2 00:26:33
Look at Unity scripts, that enabled so much.
Speaker 1 00:26:36
Exactly, exactly. So it's not like an all or nothing, but my goal would be, if more of what is currently code can move to configuration as data, think about a config services system that handles, it's like what OnBase Core did, except I don't want to have to restart the app server. Give me version config, and give me, let me run to it once, or you know, there's like interesting things you can get into, in terms of like V1, V2, next config,
Speaker 1 00:27:06
but that config can be portable between systems, like we have to think about solving for migration, and all of them, the custom code for that state, if that stuff could all live in one place, in one repository called West Virginia. And you'd be like, here's the config, here's this, here's, because like the other thing is like, the state-specific tests are now like, you know, it's like, where does the testing go? How much of this automated test is testing before, versus Kentucky doesn't break in this one situation. And it's like, the testing service area, bonkers. Like, fucking bonkers.
Speaker 2 00:27:42
And we have to like, report on that, don't we? Like, the coverage, code coverage. 
Speaker 1 00:27:45
Code coverage? Yeah, which like, I don't know, but code coverage is fine, because it's easy to fucking lie on, like, not lie, but. Yeah. You can like, touch this code, under the permutations you need, or want, but, yeah. But like, this, yeah, this plugin thing, I'm like, I just, I don't, I don't see how we would, how this will work without having an enormous staff, and moving towards configuration of the data.
Speaker 1 00:28:18
Yeah, yeah, that's complex. You can solve complexity with humans.
Speaker 2 00:28:21
Right.
Speaker 1 00:28:22
I don't know. What we're doing is not exactly simple.
Speaker 2 00:28:25
I'm not sure if I mentioned this to you, but imagine you go in with a script to a new state, like Ohio, and we ask them questions on the script, or we do our discovery call meeting, whatever, and then you give it to a Kade agent that converts it to CHAMP config, and then you're 80% of the way, yes, there's custom config, maybe there's a new thing that needs added here, and you're 80% to 90% of the way.
Speaker 1 00:28:54
From a core product, I think that would work incredibly well. It would be all the integrations, where it's like, and then what happens actually here? There's that discovery process.
Speaker 2 00:29:04
I'm just saying, I want to get us 80% of the way.
Speaker 1 00:29:08
My recommendation to you would be, well, let me think about this. So you'll hear Ian, you'll hear Dan talk about, even to some degree, you know, Beau, it's like they'll talk about, yeah, yeah, you know, someday we can have this whole point and click. I click a button and things happen and do work. Like they, that, that ideal has been described in a way that it's like, they can't even see how parts of it could be attainable today.
Speaker 1 00:29:44
So my concern would be like, if you're too aggressive on that idealistic, it's like, they already know sort of what like the ideal dream state is. They don't need, you know, they don't need to be sold there. The problem has been, how do you get there without saying we can't onboard any states until you first build a perfect platform that lets you onboard all, you know what I mean? So, so I don't know what the recommendation is, but it's like, what I've found is that finding ways to describe short term outcomes.
Speaker 1 00:30:15
that are ultimately can lead up to that like idealistic thing go further when you talk about them as directionally because then it becomes like well how we get there is just implementation details and what part of this do we want to buy off and so it's kind of a finding both what's a slice we can bite off today and how do you talk about it in a way that doesn't acknowledge the smallest bite yet pull us away from the other implementation or pull us away from the other from the limitations um because i yeah my thought was at least for this automate process this.
Speaker 2 00:30:51
processing engine yeah if i could do the title or the fees engine let me show the fees engine how complex it is and then actually show it built in this thing and say look at what i as someone who has no idea what a fees engine has built this with this mechanism yeah that. but it almost goes like what i would what i'd be showing them would be a high it's a it works but.
Speaker 2 00:31:22
it's a high fidelity mock-up essentially like you can plug it in i don't recommend plugging, i'm not a programmer so what i'm putting out there yeah yeah kind of what i've been dabbling with.
Speaker 1 00:31:39
like in my mornings and stuff one thing that would be helpful so and i can let me i'll send you. repositories because i think it's something that one thing that could be helpful for you is just to go look at the code yeah and be like all right like that was actually what i wanted to.
Speaker 2 00:31:58
i want to show okay here's they haven't built it yet here's the, hundred line you know thousand line code the custom configuring the custom code for louisiana, Here it is now built and extrapolated out, and we can plug it into TIDAL2.
Speaker 3 00:32:14
Yeah, and it might... I'll take whatever you want to send me, though, because...
Speaker 1 00:32:23
Well, it cares. So there's WS-ATRS Core Services. This is VITAS Gen 1. I didn't know that. Because they changed it. I just didn't know it. It used to be ATRS, and then they changed it to VITAS. Boom. Somebody... In here, you'll see ATRS Core. So this is supposed to be core product functionality.
Speaker 1 00:32:58
And then there's KY plug-in, West Virginia plug-in. So if you look at the KY plug-in, then you look at the West Virginia plug-in... I think this would be a thing, actually, to plot code. It's like, all right, look at config. It isn't just for the... Like, this is what I've been starting to do, is literally just like, okay, like, what is this config? Like, you know, there's an auth URL.
Speaker 1 00:33:30
There's a client ID, client secret. Okay, so this is clearly billing client. So we have... There's some... We're calling out externally to some billing thing.
Speaker 2 00:33:41
But why can't that just be extrapolated. 
Speaker 1 00:33:45
Here is...
Speaker 2 00:33:48
What's the custom bit of the fact that it's the actual endpoint.
Speaker 1 00:33:55
but maybe, you know, so if I look... All right, so here they are side by side, West Virginia versus... Like, it could be that they have different billing providers. Right. And so even the definition of what these things are needs to be different.
Speaker 2 00:34:06
Oh, and the value is totally different. But that's okay, like...
Speaker 1 00:34:10
Alright, so there's an auth, client ID, client secret, grant type...
Speaker 3 00:34:16
They're the same.
Speaker 1 00:34:17
But this one has scope. And this one has a request timeout. Right? So... It's like... This is the type of like, okay, why does... What is the common denominator? Like...
Speaker 2 00:34:32
Pull the rest of them out of the core. My hand there.
Speaker 3 00:34:38
Control order. Like DTO. Data... Answer. Object.
Speaker 1 00:34:47
Here's a phi. It's a DTO for a phi.
Speaker 2 00:34:51
That got brought up in that... The media... The event you had. The DTOs. What's the source of the truth? Like, some people will design the DTOs as the source of truth. Others are designing the DataBeam as the source of truth.
Speaker 1 00:35:06
Hmm. Oh, that's interesting. Okay. Yeah, like we're here, like this is one where there isn't even, right, it's like if you just look at, like, this is the difference, you know, and so then the question is how much of this can be extracted as configuration, and how much of it can't, for whatever reason.
Speaker 2 00:35:46
Let's just load up some of the corporate card, and we'll just say compare these data sources.
Speaker 1 00:35:53
Like this is where it's like processed, right? Like this one doesn't do anything, but this one does. And I think this is because... Kentucky needed this thing West Virginia didn't but then why even have it because if the interface describes it you have to implement it what idea is it this is IntelliJ which i would recommend.
Speaker 1 00:36:31
downloading for the java code because it does a pretty good job of like it's like this is basically what i was doing the other day where i'm like okay here's a thing, state transfer agreement head node persist process processor and that's just like clicking through. where does this thing show up you know you're like all right i see it in HRS base integration test.
Speaker 1 00:37:11
This is in the state API. Okay, so right this is a little bit different. This is a state API No, so this describes what the plugins have to implement in this case because this this I don't is it I don't think it'd be quite right to call this plug-in model, Because it's a little bit I don't know right but then you have this get plugin code, right? And now if you go get plug-in code.
Speaker 3 00:37:40
Okay, so this is in dealer core.
Speaker 1 00:38:00
so in the core there is like. Anyways, like this plug-in code. There's so many layers of direction.
Speaker 2 00:38:14
Yeah, there's the plug-in mode, the API layer. Yeah, I've been asking, where are some of those architectural, when you're talking about into the UDM. UDM? Yeah, where are you guys.
Speaker 2 00:38:46
making those decisions? Like, I just want to sit in and listen.
Speaker 1 00:38:50
Some of it, some of that, my understanding is that some of it is just like a BO.
Speaker 2 00:39:01
And... I was asking Kevin.
Speaker 1 00:39:02
They're like BOing at me a lot. but it's like so they had a perspective on what the initial one was and then it's like you know, as we engage louisiana you actually see their data your data yeah and there's a big like well what maps to what or how do you you know like i almost phil like if we're not doing that we should just.
Speaker 2 00:39:31
like all right let's go in retrospect let's go add west virginia what's wrong what breaks what.
Speaker 1 00:39:38
doesn't what like what is still custom yeah at least on the like for the vehicle side i think we could the problem is like UADM has had more thought on the credential side because that's where it's playing for first louisiana yeah rhode island needs some of the vehicle stuff but rhode island is not full vehicle like digital title solution it's like only like elts.
Speaker 3 00:40:02
and so what they need is quite slim yeah.
Speaker 1 00:40:08
But, it's like that they're, something that they're just like not sitting right with me in a way that like I can't articulate, which means I can't, aside from vibes. That's all I run off on. I gotta go. Alright.
Speaker 2 00:40:28
Good chat, I would do this more, so.
Speaker 1 00:40:30
Yeah, yeah for sure. I try to come in both like, yeah I should get you out of my house, but, I'm in here most days.

## 1. HXP Platform, Solution Architecture, and State Onboarding
### Conclusion
The current platform architecture is overly generic and unsustainable for onboarding the 51 jurisdictions. The method of using significant custom, co-located code for each state (e.g., Louisiana) leads to complexity, inefficiencies, and requires a large staff. The group agrees on the need to shift towards a more configurable, state-specific, plug-and-play architecture where functionality is handled through "configuration as data" rather than custom code. This would empower activation teams, reduce reliance on core engineering for state-specific changes (like adding new fees), and allow for faster onboarding. While the system is multi-instance, the administration and maintenance of solutions post-deployment remains an unresolved question, with the current model seemingly requiring ongoing staffed dev teams for each state. The leadership team is skeptical about the attainability of a "point and click" ideal, so any transition plan should focus on short-term, achievable outcomes.
### Plan
- [ ] Speaker 1 will conduct a deep dive with Nate to review the code, architectural decisions, and business rules. -- *Speaker 1*, *Nate* this week
- [ ] Speaker 1 will send Tyler the code repositories for WS-ATRS Core Services (VITAS Gen 1) and the state-specific plug-ins (e.g., KY, West Virginia) so Tyler can analyze the existing code. -- *Speaker 1*
- [ ] Tyler to create a video, possibly for Kevin. -- *Tyler*
- [ ] Speaker 1 to get Tyler access to a corporate AI/cloud code environment with a PPI restriction limit. -- *Speaker 1*
### Discussion Points
1. **Unsustainable Model:** The current platform approach, which involves state delivery teams implementing significant custom code, is not scalable for 51 jurisdictions. The goal is to move towards a model where teams consume existing platform features, only requiring roadmap additions for entirely new functionality.
2. **Shift to "Configuration as Data":** The ideal approach is to move from custom code to a "configuration as data" model with a versioned configuration system. The goal isn't zero custom code, but to isolate state-specific code, configuration, and tests into single, dedicated repositories for each state.
3. **Need for Configurability:** Even within one jurisdiction, there's significant complexity (e.g., 65 permutations for one fee in Louisiana), highlighting the need for a configurable engine. This requires two configuration paths: one for core platform scalability and a simplified, plug-and-play process for activation teams.
4. **Demonstrating Value:** To get leadership buy-in, it's better to propose short-term outcomes. A good proof-of-concept would be to build a complex component, like the fees engine, using a new processing engine to show it can be done without deep programming knowledge.
5. **Lack of Mapped Requirements:** Product requirements for all 51 jurisdictions are not fully mapped out, forcing development to hard-code items like credential types into enums, which requires a full deployment to change.
6. **Self-Service Goal:** The ideal state is an interface where a non-technical user (e.g., from Tabitha's team) could manage configurations like adding a new SKU or fee without involving engineering or release pipelines.
7. **Post-Deployment Maintenance:** The question of who maintains and updates a solution after initial deployment is unresolved. The current architecture seems to necessitate ongoing staffed dev teams for each state.
## 2. VTAS Gen 1 vs. Gen 2 and Code Branching Issues
### Conclusion
There is significant concern over the separate development paths for VTAS Gen 2. The UADM (Universal Data Model) codebase has been forked into two branches (one for Rhode Island using Gen 2, another for Louisiana) which have not been merged for at least four months, creating a risk of divergence. It's in the company's best interest to upgrade Gen 1 clients (e.g., West Virginia) to Gen 2 for consistency and to support new features like MyDMVGov, but the process, cost, and contractual implications of such an upgrade are unknown.
### Discussion Points
1. **Diverging Codebases:** The UADM repository has two separate, unmerged code branches for Louisiana and Rhode Island, which is causing anxiety.
2. **Gen 1 vs. Gen 2:** There are two separate codebases for VTAS Gen 1 (West Virginia, Kentucky) and VTAS Gen 2 (Rhode Island) with different functionality.
3. **Unclear Upgrade Path:** It is unclear how or if VTAS Gen 1 clients can be upgraded to Gen 2, including whether it would be a free upgrade or require a new contract. It is assumed the company would not want to perform the upgrade for free.
4. **Strategic Importance of Upgrades:** Upgrading clients is beneficial for launching new platform-wide features, as it avoids having to support two different generations of the platform.
## 3. Analysis of Existing Code and "Plug-in" Model
### Conclusion
An analysis of the West Virginia and Kentucky "plug-ins" reveals both commonalities that could be abstracted and state-specific variations, even for similar functions. The current "plug-in" model is not a true plug-in architecture; it's complex, with many layers of indirection that make it difficult to understand. Architectural decisions for the UDM appear to be made ad-hoc by individuals like Beau, refined as real state data is encountered. Further investigation is needed to determine what can be standardized versus what must remain custom.
### Discussion Points
1. **Configuration Differences:** Comparing West Virginia and Kentucky plug-ins shows that even a common function like a billing client has different configuration needs (e.g., one requires a `scope` field, the other does not), illustrating the challenge of creating a universal configuration.
2. **Complex "Plug-in" Model:** The current code structure is not a true plug-in system. It forces implementations (like Kentucky's) to have logic while others (West Virginia's) are empty, simply to satisfy a required interface.
3. **Ad-Hoc Architecture Decisions:** The process for making UDM architectural decisions is unclear, appearing to be made by individuals and then refined based on specific state needs as they arise. For example, the credential side of the UDM is more developed for Louisiana, while the vehicle side is slimmer for Rhode Island due to their more limited scope.
## 4. The Ambiguity of "Queues"
### Conclusion
The term "queue" is used ambiguously within the organization, creating confusion. It can refer to at least three different concepts: the underlying technology (e.g., RabbitMQ), work items organized by status (workflow queues), and a separate product concept for managing physical lines at a DMV. This conflation of terms makes technical and product discussions difficult.
### Discussion Points
1. **Multiple Meanings:** The word "queue" is used to describe different concepts: the technical implementation (RabbitMQ), workflow statuses for grouping work items, and the physical line of people at a DMV.
2. **Conflation Causes Confusion:** When someone says "queue," they could be referring to any of these concepts, making communication imprecise. The technical queues (RabbitMQ) are currently manually hard-coded.
## 5. KATE (AI/Document Processing)
### Conclusion
There is an opportunity to improve the KATE AI offering. The current approach appears to involve handcrafted, hard-coded agents for each use case. A more beneficial approach could be to use an "AI agent builder" that allows for rapid crafting of agents with custom rules in plain English. There is also a lack of formal model evaluation. Tyler will seek more involvement in KATE discussions to provide input.
### Discussion Points
1. **Improving KATE:** The current document processing could be enhanced by prototyping new methods. The approach seems to be building hard-coded AI agents with specific system prompts.
2. **"AI Agent Builder" Concept:** An agent builder that allows for creating custom rules in plain English could be a more effective approach.
3. **Model Evaluation:** There is a potential to use open-source or third-party utilities for model evaluation, which does not seem to be happening. The constraint that solutions must run in Bedrock might not preclude external evaluation frameworks.
4. **Level of Concern:** Speaker 1 has less anxiety here, as the work is relatively isolated. It's also unclear how self-service the AI configuration needs to be for end-users versus internal teams.
**AI Suggestions**
AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
1. **Unclear Strategy for Phased Transition:** While the team agrees on a "configuration as data" vision, there's no concrete, phased plan to transition from the current custom-code model. A follow-up is needed to define the first proof-of-concept (e.g., the fees engine) and a roadmap for migrating other components.
2. **Diverging Codebases Risk:** The Universal Data Model (UADM) has two active, unmerged branches (Louisiana and Rhode Island) that have been separate for at least four months. This poses a significant risk. A clear strategy and timeline for merging these branches needs to be established immediately.
3. **Ambiguous VTAS Gen 1 to Gen 2 Upgrade Path:** While upgrading Gen 1 clients to Gen 2 is strategically important, there is no clarity on the process, contractual implications (paid vs. free), or technical effort required. This needs to be defined to create a proper roadmap.
4. **Unclear Post-Deployment Maintenance Model:** There is no defined plan for who is responsible for maintaining and updating state-specific configurations post-deployment. A decision is needed on whether this will be handled by a central team, state teams, or enabled via a self-service UI.
5. **Ownership of Product Configuration:** There is no concrete plan or ownership assigned to build the desired self-service UI for non-technical users to manage configurations like SKUs and fees. This should be formally added to a product roadmap.
6. **Lack of Clarity on Architectural Decision-Making:** The process for architectural decisions (e.g., for the UDM) appears ad-hoc. A formal process or regular architectural review meeting should be established to ensure stakeholders are informed and can contribute.
7. **Clarification on KATE Evaluation Strategy:** The team is not using formal evaluation frameworks for its AI models, citing a Bedrock constraint. It needs to be clarified if this constraint applies only to production models or also to evaluation frameworks, as a structured approach could improve quality.
