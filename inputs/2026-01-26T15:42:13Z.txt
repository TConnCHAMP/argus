Speaker 1 00:00:06
And the fees, the fees. Right, so building. Trying to figure out. We need whatever we need to build for Louisiana and to get them out the door and launch by September. Um, we have a need in Kentucky to build something like that. Um overall we need to just build our productized PIM approach and then calculate. 
Speaker 1 00:00:36
So it's, you know, how do we manage all of these SKUs? And. Then how do we use that to calculate? And how does this state plugin rules work with the core engine so that it's people scalable. 
Speaker 2 00:00:50
And all built on the unified data model. Yes. Fun.
Speaker 1 00:00:60
Yeah. You get to start with the hard stuff.
Speaker 2 00:01:02
Yeah, I like i. 
Speaker 2 00:01:05
It's something to think about, at least at the very least. So,
Speaker 1 00:01:09
Yeah. But, it has it's such a huge need, and it's it has been such a huge blocker and constraint from a revenue growth perspective, the way that we've done it in the past. So like in Kentucky for example, They. 
Speaker 3 00:01:36
That they do. Yeah.
Speaker 1 00:01:45
So that's each vehicle class, each transaction type, Whether it's a salvage or reconstruction, or you know we're starting to learn all those terms, Um or if it's a different plate class, there is different personalized plate or standard. You know, for all those things, we hardcoded everyone.
Speaker 1 00:02:06
And we went to market with only a subset of them, Which now means we can't do the rest of them without then hard coding, all of them. And we are not; those are all revenue drivers for us. Right, So if we can't do the transaction, we can't collect the revenue. Sure, But we need to build it in a way that we are not hard coding, a new transaction and a new vehicle class or a new, whatever, every time you want to add one. Right, It has to be configurable, and it should just be as easy as adding a new skew, or you know, whatever that may be.
Speaker 2 00:02:44
Hmm. We had theum the meeting we had earlier around fees and skews and all that. I got my hands on the Miro, and it is ever sprawling. So yeah, I started looking through that. That was asking about it looks like it's being built for Louisiana, but keeping in mind. He has a table. He has a table of like state SKUs. Yeah, maybe strap with him now. Yeah, So I think I am going to try and meet with him some more to understand that.
Speaker 1 00:03:16
So yeah, it's a big need.
Speaker 2 00:03:21
Okay, So that is a good. So that's kind of where I've been almost not digging in deep, but like looking more at was the fee side of things.
Speaker 2 00:03:33
Less involved with the car. I mean, the cart plays a role,
Speaker 1 00:03:36
But it's really just how they display fees. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, Yeah So. It's mostly the fees how we can configure it Yep How we can update it? Yeah How, we can eventually make it self- service if they need to change a price. Right Like all of that kind of like We kind of have to roadmap that kind of product. 
Speaker 2 00:03:58
Look Yes Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:04:03
Yeah, that was something Kerry didn't necessarily have a. I don't think I asked the question the right way either, but like the configurability aspect of it. Do we want to expose that to state administrators?
Speaker 1 00:04:15
I think eventually. Yeah. The more we can allow them to self service without obviously breaking our product, right?
Speaker 2 00:04:22
The better.
Speaker 1 00:04:22
The better So like if yeah, if they need to change the price of a plate, right They shouldn't have to go to us, right They should be able to go and pull up their SKUs and. 
Speaker 1 00:04:34
Line or you know effective next week, this price is now this. Yeah. Amy's going to take us there a long time to get there. Sure. We, we want to build it so that first, we can get it out the door and be. 
Speaker 2 00:04:48
I almost want us to be the I want to build it in a way that makes sense for us to quickly configure it.
Speaker 1 00:04:54
Right. Then you expose them to them? Yeah We shouldn't build it. So it's hard for us to configure right,
Speaker 2 00:05:01
Which it seems like it is now.
Speaker 2 00:05:10
Okay, I wanted to make sure I was on kind of the right path.
Speaker 1 00:05:14
Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely priority number one. Okay. Priority number two will be our data canvas.
Speaker 3 00:05:33
PIM You said PIM?
Speaker 1 00:05:38
Yeah, they're kind of treating the fees and tax engine somewhat separate from him.
Speaker 3 00:05:49
Yeah, it seems like they're very interconnected. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1 00:05:56
So we want to build a data mart and then be able to expose. Say data mart? Data mart, yeah.
Speaker 2 00:06:04
Like a dairy mart but like. Data, yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1 00:06:09
Um, just a you know, At the end of the day, we want to be able to expose a dashboard so that states can pull their own reports, visualize their data.
Speaker 2 00:06:20
And we use Metabase now. Do we want to continue to use Metabase?
Speaker 1 00:06:27
Uh, not client facing. We want to build it into our application.
Speaker 2 00:06:32
Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2 00:06:38
But Metabase could still be the source of truth.
Speaker 1 00:06:41
It could be. I don't know if it will be. I don't know if that's a decision moving forward.
Speaker 2 00:06:45
Metabase was actually something that we looked at.
Speaker 1 00:06:48
It has a lot of limitations. Yeah,
Speaker 2 00:06:51
It was like quick to get stood up, but there wasn't a lot of like we call it OEM, Like there was not a lot of OEM configurability Yes What else did we look at? SciSense? I love SciSense. I almost bought. Yeah, yeah, they were. They had kind of an old older school look. MetaBase was definitely like the most modern looking. Um, but SciSense was the most configurable. So. Yeah, we almost went with them. They got sidetracked for this new AI stuff, but yeah,
Speaker 1 00:07:28
We use Power BI.
Speaker 2 00:07:31
Yeah. Did. 
Speaker 1 00:07:34
Not did not. 
Speaker 2 00:07:38
I like to think as I'm playing through the software, I'm like, ooh, Abby touched this or oh, Abby didn't have anything to say with this. So it's a little game I like to play. Yeah.
Speaker 1 00:07:51
That's a bit lower.
Speaker 2 00:08:11
Um, while I have you.
Speaker 3 00:08:15
KPIs and metrics for the states. Are those stored anywhere? Do we have those? No, okay.
Speaker 1 00:08:23
Was actually just talking about that with Brett. Okay. The indicators for this We're not great at KPIs. 
Speaker 2 00:08:29
Okay Yeah I was just thinking from like a level of how do they measure success And? Then how do we say we made it better?
Speaker 1 00:08:41
For some products, it's really easy. Um, like for ELT and ERT, uh we get revenue off of the transactions volume. Yeah. Um and the state also makes money on volume. So we win, they win on that kind of side. Uh so on ELT it would be just uh liens, lien ads. So anytime a lien is added. We make money There's a bunch of different lien transactions. But.
Speaker 1 00:09:11
The biggest one. Okay. Um, so like the the North Star metric is that for ELT? There's also a level of utilization rate that we're trying to get to. So, the number of state, the number of liens added in the entire state. Yeah. What was the percentage of them that were electronic? Still do paper liens?
Speaker 2 00:09:36
To show that it's being adopted almost?
Speaker 1 00:09:38
Exactly. So, that is not a metric, Insights into and we actually talked about it today. Um, that we want to, we can in West Virginia because we own all the data. Okay. But in other states, we don't own the data so we have to ask them every time like, hey, what's the total lean volume? And then we only know the electronic lean piece of it. So, there's actually a bit of a focus right nowum to get better insights into that. Okay.
Speaker 1 00:10:10
On the agency portals, like CICS credentialing side, it's less clear because there is no revenue driver. The agency portal is kind of a loss leader for us;. It's just sticky for us with the state. The clerk uses it like they don't have a choice. It's not like we can make it worse. 
Speaker 2 00:10:32
Or better. 
Speaker 1 00:10:34
Once the state aligns to it.; all their people use it. Is that an option? So, it's not like we can onboard more users or like make it better for them that leads to adoption.
Speaker 2 00:10:45
We could speed things up or speed their usage up.
Speaker 1 00:10:48
Most of the metrics on that side are about efficiency. So we have metrics like on the vehicle services side, it's called cycle time, And it's the amount of days, on average, a title tran like a title application goes from being submitted from a dealer to approved. So that cycle time is, Main metric from an efficiency use. 
Speaker 2 00:11:14
For for V TOS. Okay.
Speaker 1 00:11:17
Yeah, but that only speaks to the title transfer side. Um when it's somebody like walking in off the street, saying, like, hey, I have this title. We don't do anything right now to measure the impact of how our product helps them do that area of opportunity.
Speaker 2 00:11:36
There almost needs to be like an observability like a whole. And maybe that's what the D A R is, but like that level of observability across the whole ecosystem.
Speaker 1 00:11:45
Yeah, it's really easy when it comes to the transfer agreements. Yeah, you review it and then you do an action on it. It's a lot harder to understand like how the metric that would be helpful. Um is kind of time a customer in front of you. Right, if you think of the front office, typically we talk in front office. The back office is the transfer agreement. It's very easy to monitor that. Front office, it's really about how many customers are you servicing a day? How quickly are you getting them in and out? How long are they waiting? All of that's really driven off of thequeuing that a state may have. Like we don't have access to that information. We don't know how long they. 
Speaker 2 00:12:31
Just push it or we just grab it.
Speaker 1 00:12:33
It's yeah,
Speaker 2 00:12:35
Like they push it to us and we pick it up.
Speaker 1 00:12:36
Yeah, so we actually want, Build our own queuing product. I'll send you what what we're looking at right now. We're actually looking to like purchase a tool. That's an API only that we can use for the queuing. And online scheduling, Which would then allow us to build that into our platform and allow us to control wait times time with a certain customer. West Virginia doesn't even have that one. We couldn't ask them what's the average time a customer is at the desk. They don't even. 
Speaker 1 00:13:08
Because their clerks don't close out in a session.
Speaker 3 00:13:11
Right. Hmm. How are. 
Speaker 2 00:13:16
You guys using any of the three of you? Maybe not you, but thank you for the chat.
Speaker 3 00:13:40
I uh I don't see any of my family getting married.

## 1. Productized Fees/Tax Engine and SKU Configurability for State Deployments
### Conclusion
Prioritize building a configurable, state-pluggable fees/tax engine and SKU management approach on a unified data model to avoid hardcoding and enable rapid configuration for Louisiana (launch by September) and Kentucky, with eventual self-service capabilities for state administrators.
### Plan
- [ ] Design and implement a configurable fees/tax engine integrated with state-specific plugin rules on the unified data model; target readiness for Louisiana’s launch by September — *Tyler* *Kelly McCourt* [September]
- [ ] Review and align on SKU table structures and state SKU mappings; meet with the owner of the existing Miro/state SKUs to clarify model and gaps — *Tyler*
- [ ] Roadmap self-service configuration for state admins (price updates, effective dates) after internal configurability is delivered — *Kelly McCourt* *Tyler*
### Discussion Points
1. [Kelly McCourt]: Hardcoding transactions, vehicle classes, and plate classes has constrained revenue growth; configurability is required to scale and capture all revenue drivers.
   - Kentucky example: each vehicle class and transaction type (salvage, reconstruction), personalized vs. standard plate classes were hardcoded
   - Went to market with a subset; remaining items cannot be supported without further hardcoding
2. [Tyler]: Focus initial efforts on the fees side and ensure it’s built on the unified data model with state SKU tables; coordinate with the owner of the Miro/state SKUs.
   - Miro board is “ever sprawling”; appears built for Louisiana with a table of state SKUs
3. [Kelly McCourt]: Expose configurability to state administrators eventually to allow price changes without vendor involvement, but first ensure it’s easy for internal teams to configure.
   - Example: “effective next week, this price is now this”
4. [Tyler]: Current system seems hard for internal configuration; build for fast internal config first, then expose to clients.
5. [Speaker 3]: Fees/tax engine and PIM are interconnected despite being treated somewhat separately.
6. [Tyler]: Cart’s role is mainly fee display; core need is fee configuration and update mechanisms, with a roadmap toward self-service.
## 2. Data Mart and Client-Facing Analytics/Dashboard Strategy
### Conclusion
Build a data mart and embed client-facing dashboards within the application (not Metabase), enabling states to self-serve reporting and data visualization; tooling choice remains undecided.
### Plan
- [ ] Define the data mart schema and ingestion from operational systems to support state dashboards (KPIs, utilization, efficiency metrics) — *Kelly McCourt* *Tyler*
- [ ] Evaluate embedded analytics tooling options (e.g., continue with Metabase as internal source vs. alternatives like Sisense, Power BI OEM) for client-facing dashboards; make a decision — *Tyler* *Kelly McCourt*
- [ ] Scope “Data Canvas” as Priority #2 following the fees engine work — *Kelly McCourt*
### Discussion Points
1. [Kelly McCourt]: Aim to expose dashboards so states can pull reports and visualize data; prefer embedding into the application over using Metabase client-facing.
2. [Tyler]: Metabase can remain as source of truth internally, but client-facing embedding is limited; prior evaluations included Metabase and Sisense.
   - Metabase: quick setup, modern-looking, limited OEM configurability
   - Sisense: most configurable, older look; almost selected previously
3. [Kelly McCourt]: Power BI has been used; implied limitations or misfit for current client-facing needs.
4. [Speaker 3]: Fees/tax engine and PIM appear interconnected, suggesting data mart should consider these integrations.
5. [Tyler]: “Data Canvas” identified as Priority #2, after the fees engine priority.
## 3. KPI Framework and Measurement Across Products (ELT/ERT, Agency Portals, VTOS)
### Conclusion
Current KPI practices are inconsistent; for ELT, North Star is lien additions and electronic utilization rate, but data availability varies by state. Agency portals lack direct revenue metrics; efficiency metrics (e.g., cycle time) are key. Broader KPI and observability framework is needed across front and back office.
### Plan
- [ ] Define standardized KPIs across products and states (ELT utilization, VTOS cycle time, front-office throughput/wait times) and establish data sourcing strategies where the company doesn’t own data — *Kelly McCourt* *Tyler*
- [ ] Engage states to obtain total lien volume where data is not owned; implement processes to regularly collect these figures — *Kelly McCourt*
- [ ] Identify gaps in front-office observability and propose instrumentation/queuing integration to measure customer wait time and service throughput — *Tyler*
### Discussion Points
1. [Speaker 3]: Asked if KPIs and state metrics are stored; current answer is no.
2. [Kelly McCourt]: For ELT/ERT, revenue tied to transaction volume; ELT North Star is lien additions and electronic utilization rate.
   - In West Virginia, the company owns the data and can measure; in other states, must request total lien volume
3. [Tyler]: KPI framework should show how states measure success and how the product improves it; observability across the ecosystem is needed.
4. [Kelly McCourt]: Agency portals are loss leaders; adoption is mandated once a state aligns, so efficiency metrics matter more than user growth.
   - VTOS metric: cycle time from dealer submission to approval (days)
   - Front office: number of customers serviced per day, speed of service, wait times; data dependent on state queuing, which the company currently lacks access to
## 4. Queuing and Online Scheduling Product for Front-Office Observability
### Conclusion
A queuing and online scheduling capability is required to instrument front-office metrics (wait times, time with customer) and improve control; plan to evaluate/purchase an API-only tool to integrate into the platform. West Virginia lacks session close-out, limiting measurement.
### Plan
- [ ] Evaluate and potentially purchase an API-only queuing/online scheduling tool to integrate into the platform for measuring wait times and session durations — *Kelly McCourt* *Tyler*
- [ ] Share current vendor/tool options and requirements to align on selection criteria — *Kelly McCourt*
### Discussion Points
1. [Kelly McCourt]: Wants to build or integrate queuing and online scheduling to enable measurement and control of front-office metrics.
   - West Virginia example: clerks don’t close out sessions, so average desk time cannot be measured
2. [Tyler]: Clarified data push/pull models; integration approach may determine observability.
3. [Speaker 3]: Acknowledged the need and implications of session handling for measurement.
> AI Suggestions
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. Tooling decision for client-facing analytics: The team has not selected an embedded analytics solution for the data mart/dashboard (Metabase vs. Sisense vs. other). Define requirements (OEM/embed configurability, security, multi-tenant support), compare options, and set a decision deadline aligned with the “Data Canvas” Priority #2.
> 2. State administrator self-service scope and guardrails: While eventual self-service for fee/SKU updates is desired, specifics (which fields, approval workflows, effective dating, validation rules, rollback mechanisms) and access controls remain undefined. Establish a phased scope and governance model before exposing configuration externally.
> 3. Data acquisition for ELT utilization in non-owned data states: The process to regularly obtain total lien volumes from states is unspecified. Assign owners, define frequency and format, and secure data-sharing agreements to ensure utilization KPIs can be calculated reliably.
> 4. Queuing/online scheduling vendor selection and integration plan: The meeting referenced evaluating/purchasing an API-only tool, but criteria, candidate vendors, and timelines are unclear. Create a shortlist, run a technical/UX evaluation, and commit to an integration timeline to unlock front-office observability.
> 5. Louisiana September launch risk due to fees engine dependencies: The fees/tax engine configurability and state plugin rules are critical path items, yet detailed milestones and resource assignments are not defined. Develop a dated delivery plan with interim checkpoints to mitigate the September launch risk.
