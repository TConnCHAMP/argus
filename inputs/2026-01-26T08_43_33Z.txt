there's the echo all right um somebody on zoom can you give us a sound check can you hear us aaron testing hill in darren someone all right awesome, All right, well, welcome everyone to the first of the four product showcases. Really excited everyone to get the time to be here. Yes! Woo! Right? Awesome. Take us off. We're going to start with a little bit of background on why are we doing the showcase series with purpose. Why did you all block out an hour on your middle of your Thursday to do this?
00:00:31
We're going to talk cars, paper, and cars full of paper. Kind of the problems that the quote-unquote ERT solution solves. We'll get into what that means, what ERT stands for, and then we'll talk about two of our products that do the ERT thing for us. One being ETRS, the second being Clearinghouse, and then of course we've got the time again for Q&A. I will say, before we get into the hour books, I'm not going to say we aren't going to use the full hour, we're not, but we have a full hour book, so if we do that early, if there are any questions, we'll be here, happy to answer any. Miguel, Naomi, Christine, and I are going to be monitoring the chat as well, so if you have questions, throw them in the chat. Those of us who are here, feel free to raise your hand. We're going to try to save them towards the end, but if there are questions that are relevant.
00:01:01
and aren't going to kind of throw us out of the ball, then you might have to request a question. All right, so let's kick off. Why are we here? What's the fun of the showcase series? So Shane said it best. We have an incredible suite of products that our customers love using. Honestly, I don't think the knowledge internally is very high. Anybody raise their hand and say that they can name all of our products right now. You can't see the Zoom hands, but I'm assuming there are none. So Blaze is on my team. You don't count. Patrick, you've been here for a while. You don't count. But we all need to know what our products do, who uses them, what problems they solve, and really how we fit into the marketplace. The more we all know, the better we can all grow as a company and scale and really bring our products to the marketplace. So these are our products.
00:01:32
We see icons of our products. And the goal of the showcase is going to be to give everybody some foundational knowledge of each of these, what they do, who they serve, and what problems they solve. So contrast on the screen isn't great, but we'll send this back out. This is sort of a very quick and dirty explanation of how everything connects together. Engineers, it's probably far off. Please don't send me any angry messages in Slack. But generally speaking, this is how all of our systems connect together, how data flows between, and then dotted lines sort of indicate supporting systems or systems that sort of help each other to accomplish goals. So over the course of the next four weeks, we will look at all of these apps. Today, we've got ETRS Clearinghouse. On the 6th, next week, we've got Retos and Cade.
00:02:04
The following week, on the 14th, we've got ELTS and comms. And then we are going to wrap up on the 19th, just before Thanksgiving, with DTS, kind of the capstone of all our products. So this is the product and design team. You know us, you love us. Each of us will be presenting some piece of content over the next four weeks, except for Maria, but I didn't want to put her up here because she's designed all of our apps, and she's amazing. Go Maria! Go Maria. So yeah, this is all of us, as well as the products that we are associated with. If you aren't already familiar, these are the people to go to with questions. Great, so let's jump into a little bit of background on ERT and why it's a thing. So let me tell you guys a little story. My friend named Charles here, he just bought a new car. Brand new, red, looks like a hatchback of some sort. Let's say it's a Mazda. Just left the dealership with his new car.
00:02:43
He's got a car in person. Filled out paperwork. There's a ton of paperwork to fill out. These days, it's not an e-sign. You'll fill it out on a tablet or sign it on a tablet. But effectively, there's a lot of paperwork that's collected. So Charles is going to fill out that paper at the DMV. And he's going to go home. He's going to take his new car home, and the papers go to basically a back office clerk. And that back office clerk is going to package that paper up, throw it in the mail, and it's going to make its way over to the DMV office. Again, this is assuming a fully paper-based process. Those documents that he filled out, the title application, you know, lead information if he took out a loan on the vehicle, it's going to make its way over to the DMV. I think what you're starting to see, and you'll continue to see, is there's a lot of time in between these things that happen.
00:03:15
So, paper gets over to the DMV, they need to review it. As you might imagine, it takes a little bit of time. It gets to the DMV, it goes to the mailroom, it's sorted in the mailroom, added to somebody's desk. Like, it sits on somebody's desk for a couple days, it's then reviewed, and ah, shoot, the dealer forgot a piece of paper. Sent back to the dealer through the mail, could take days, could take weeks, could take months, depending on how backed up the USPS is. But that process will continue until the dealer has provided satisfactory paperwork to get it typed in. So, it could take, again, months. Some states have deadlines by which this should happen, 60 days, 90 days, but it really depends on the case. But at some point, the DMV says, we have everything we need. Charles can get the title for his car.
00:03:45
And that ends up in his mailbox in paper form. So it took me probably about a minute and a half to explain this process. But in reality, it can take 30 plus days all at once. In West Virginia, which is the first state to launch ETRS, it was taking north of 40 days at one point, from the point of sale to the point where the customer was receiving a paper title. Two separate occasions. One actually this week, so great timing. And one about a year or so ago, DMV was approving these in real time. So Charles was buying his car, same day, deciding to speak to kind of the benefits of how ERT can solve this. So again, this is a fully paper-based process. I believe it's somewhere around the early 2000s, maybe a little bit after that, somebody in the industry introduced electronic registration type.
00:04:16
And that is a fancy industry term, much like ELT, for the process of sending paperwork, data from dealership to the DMV to accelerate that titling process. So eSTART, which is a coalition of industry members and stakeholders, fantastic resource as well. Link is there. If you are interested at all in learning more, it's a great place to start. But they've got a really good explanation. It's a processor system whereby any user, such as a licensed dealer, can submit the necessary title. Registration data to the state or across the country. The output of that process. But the real key that I'm getting out here is all of the times that we would have typically transmitted things back and forth from the dealer to the DMV and paper are now doing electronically through the ERT system.
00:04:51
So now that you guys are all experts on paper process and ERT, let's talk about our products.
00:04:55
I hope I know how to use the mouse. Just don't scroll. All right. So I'll be explaining about our product, EGRS, which I'm a product owner for. And if we go to the wrong place, what's your screen over there? There you go. That's okay. All right. So EGRS stands for electronic title registration service. As Tyler mentioned, we do have that implemented on the West Virginia state and with them as well. which the next I'm going to use your episode, I guess.
00:05:26
We have that implemented in West Virginia and Kentucky. With West Virginia, we actually have Tyler Tech as our assistant vendor, third-party vendor. And in Kentucky as well, we do have B2, another vendor, and also Tyler Tech. Everything that is highlighted in blue right now is the states using ETRS. And the ones that kind of like highlight issue with blue is Prospect ETRS. So go and see so that you can close those deals. So ETRS in West Virginia was launched in Q4 of 2021. I started, I don't know, last year. So has been really good numbers here.
00:05:58
A little bit over 500,000 transactions process up to date. As I mentioned, we do have integration with other partners. So in West Virginia, the dealers go and log into our vehicle registration system, which is this screen, also known as VRS. And while they go in there typing in all this information, what they needed to the customer, once you go out to buy a car, they fill out the information here. However, they do use our UI, what we call our dealer portal, to upload evidence before submitting to the states. So why I know it's acronym here, it's kind of like call dealers right now as well,
00:06:29
but not necessarily everybody's going to use the dealer portal. Why I'm saying this is because in Kentucky, we launched Q2 of 2024, a little bit over 5,000 transactions up to date. And for Kentucky, they don't have the dealer portal, but they use what we call our hand list API. So they just go, create a few of these electronic information, and they send to the DMV through hand list API. And again, we do have integrations with other vendors as well. That's what I have.
00:07:00
And I'll pass to Christina. Oh, sorry. Kyla has some updates for you.
00:07:05
So a couple of things to expect for dealer portals. So you probably got the sense from Naomi. Our dealer portals are right there. It filled the gaps that we needed to do in West Virginia, but we are, to my own point, in those prospective states, looking to roll out and really build the functionality. One of the next things that is coming in West Virginia and other states as well is the digital title vault. So that's really going to be the way that dealers can interact with digital titles. I'm not going to jump the gun and explain how and why, but we'll get more into this in a couple weeks. But this is something that we are actively working on, literally as of this morning, in the ETRS portal in West Virginia. How dealers can stay interactively.
00:07:37
Sorry, I don't know how to speak, so that's why.
00:07:38
You're good. And then looking way ahead, future, something that's on our roadmap. We haven't really got to it yet because we haven't really gotten a second opportunity other than to kind of generalize. But this concept of a global ERP gateway, and those of us who know ELT know the benefits. And again, I think we'll talk a little bit more about it in the ELT session, but just as it is. On the left there, we have a many-to-one integration. So traditionally, in states that support DRT, dealers will work with what we call service providers, DSDs, dealer service providers often. These are the V2s, dealer tracks, CDRs, VRSs of the world. They essentially connect to the dealer's inventory system to capture that data and start sending it along to the appropriate.
00:08:09
partners. But traditionally, a service provider has to integrate with each state. So if there's 50 different states that offer DRT, that's 50 integrations for the service provider to manage. Obviously a lot of work to do. And anytime anything changes, you're managing 50 independent, deployments of that system. On the ELT side, we've introduced this concept of a global ELT gateway, where we want to extend to DRT. So the concept would be, in all of the states where we have supported a DRT system, there would be a single gateway that they would connect through, and then based on the state in which that person is trying to do business, we would route it to the appropriate agency. So from the service provider standpoint, it's a single integration with our service. Of course, there's updates and things we push out, but less of a burden for the service providers to reintegrate.
00:08:41
every single time they want to use the state. And, as an added bonus, we can standardize processes across the states to really kind of make things better across the lake. So this is kind of a, you know, where we are right now with ETRS, where we're going, and then kind of way future where we're going. Let's talk about Clearinghouse. Clearinghouse is the product that dealers outside of the state of West Virginia use to reap the benefits of the really speedy West Virginia system.
00:08:59
And Christine's going to talk to us about that. Go on, Nina.
00:09:06
I'll start with my question. Okay. So Clearinghouse is, it's actually a national digital clearinghouse, and it's about both. So everyone here in the state of Clearinghouse, everybody knows it by Clearinghouse. And what ETRS does in the state, we are doing for non-resident businesses. So Clearinghouse allows non-resident businesses, NRVs, to acquire a West Virginia title from anywhere in the U.S. the same day. And how it has worked before is we already heard the process. I'm not going to repeat that. But imagine that you are a business, you're a dealer acquisition,
00:09:39
and you are in California, you're doing business in 10 different states. You are going to have to remember every document, every requirement for that state. And that's a lot to keep track of. And imagine if you are even bigger and you do business in 20 states. It's just a lot to keep records of and remembering, and your team is going to have to remember it, and other things over the fees. That's something that in-state kind of doesn't really have to worry about. But if you're a business and if you are acquiring a car from Ohio, the fee is $15, but in New Jersey, it's $60. Imagine if you, every year, are going to try to plan your business. How many cars, how much expenses can we put on acquiring cars for the titles?
00:10:11
If it costs $15 or $60, there's a very big difference in cost. You always have to plan for the worst-case scenario that all the cars are not coming to New Jersey. That's the price you're going to have to pay. And now instead, with Clearinghouse, we're solving that problem. So we're solving the problem with different requirements, different forms, differentiating fees, and a standardized cycle time and stuff. So like Tyler said, it can take up to 40 days sometimes. I know when I talked to Morgan before, we talked between two to 60 days, I think we talked about. And now instead, they can get the title within the same day. If they're submitting everything, have a perfect application that gets in in the morning,
00:10:41
they can have their title at the end of the day. And I'm pretty new still. Let's see. So I'm still pretty new at Champ. I started two months ago. And when I first started with Clearinghouse, I did have a... like I'm struggling understanding all the key players for clearinghouse and I know a lot of you are helping with that so I kind of try to see them as internal key players and external key players. The external key players are going to be the client party that are actually wanting to get the title and the service providers who are in our case our biggest one in DDI they're helping them submitting an application and then we have the DMV they're actually sitting there in West Virginia accepting or rejecting the application. The internal key key players are going to be all.
00:11:14
our systems that we're using. We are currently using S10 but in the future we're going to use KdenCost. Another internal key player is also the dev team, the client operations, the QA, everyone that Diggly are working to put in clearhouse is also the, So the process for Clearinghouse today is that an inquiring party submits an application and that application gets sent in just like with Kentucky through Headless API. And this is where I was struggling. I was like, why isn't there UI? Like Clearinghouse doesn't have a UI and Clearinghouse itself doesn't have a UI. We're actually using a stamp. And that goes into a stamp and then later on into the DMV that are utilizing these.
00:11:46
tests, which you're going to hear about later. And then within six hours, they're getting the title back, either as a digital or a paper form. Clearinghouse is relatively new so they started mid-year last year. ETRS started in 2021 Q2 and when we started last year Clearinghouse only did have one service provider I believe and they are no longer in business and we only did have a couple hundred transactions but this year we have actually increased our number of service providers we have also increased our number of transactions of course we're not close to half a million transactions like ETRS but we're getting there so in the future what we want for Clearinghouse is that we want to increase the number of service provider but it doesn't do us any good if they're inactive service providers we need them to be active we need them to be educated on our product so they.
00:12:23
can bring in the transactions because they're bringing the transactions we get the money as well and then the vision that you originally had for Clearinghouse was it for it to be fully automated for as much as possible and you're going to hear about comms and K8 later in these sessions and those two systems are the ones that will enable Clearinghouse to become as automated as possible.
00:12:42
Great, thanks Christine, I appreciate the Q&A. There's nothing on the chat either. That means we did a phenomenal job.
00:12:50
They already knew everything, nothing new. Should I stop sharing? No questions? Damn, you guys.
00:13:02
No questions? All right, I'll ask you a question.
00:13:06
What differentiates our clearinghouse product from other clearinghouse products in the nation? That's a great question, Blaise. I would say, and I don't want to get into all the details, other clearinghouses, I believe there's only one, Dan Morgan, someone else on the call, if that's incorrect, China. But from what I gather, it's a lot more manual. It relies on that party who set up the clearinghouse essentially acting as a dealer in the state. So whereas we partner with the government, they're partnering with a dealership. So just the inherent ability. Given DMV's approval, obviously, that's a requirement,
00:13:36
we would be able to automate clearinghouse at some point. So things literally would be approved in real time, assuming that they pass the checks that are in place. And the deal title as well is obviously a big part of that.
00:13:45
Thank you. All clearinghouse transactions right now currently just involve a West Virginia company.
00:13:51
Oh, that's a good question. In terms of starting with a West Virginia title? Yeah. No.
00:13:58
No, no, no. In any state. Yeah, in any state. We prefer if they don't use clearinghouse when they are submitting a West Virginia title to a West Virginia title.
00:14:07
Okay. But the output is always West Virginia. So the use case there is, I'm Carvana, let's say. I bought a car in Arizona and I now want to flip the title in my name. I could go through the Arizona DMV and that could take two to 60 days or I could go to West Virginia, get a West Virginia title in Carvana's name and then I can sell that now. As a dealer, national dealer, you can do the clearinghouse. The goal is to get the title in your name as soon as you can so you can flip it. Sell it outside of West Virginia. Yes, exactly. So you're getting around your own state's limitations. Exactly. In the same way that Delaware is a clearinghouse for companies, we are sort of a clearinghouse for title. Okay. Apply to a West Virginia title quickly and just get it together.
00:14:38
Shane posts a comment, I mean a question. What keeps you up at night regarding these products. 
00:14:43
No, you go first. I'm a good boy. 
00:14:47
I would say I was not able to sleep due to the presentation. Does that answer your question? She's so excited to share her ECRS. Oh, no, Shane. Tough one. I'll pass the ball. I don't know. Somebody else. Transaction of brand mapping.
00:15:02
I would say on the ETR side, we've done it for ELT at this point, but standardizing our transaction set, I think, is top of mind for me and will be many of the next state. ELT, we've done it enough times where we know there's a set of 15 transactions, something like that, that all lenders will use. We're getting to that point with the dealer. So when we launched in West Virginia, we essentially supported a title application. That was it. I think at some point we supported salvage. We supported other types of vehicles. When we entered Kentucky, there was a concept of requesting a duplicate title. There's dealer assignments. There's all different types of transactions that the dealer would have to send things to the DMV. So figuring out what that master set is and then standardizing that across the states, I think, is our next big challenge, as well as, I mean, the type of all-tent global ERT things there are.
00:15:35
I will add to what Juan just said.
00:15:37
I guess that's my technique. It's like making sure the data is the same across, and not just the data, but the fields. Some of the places, like, maybe on the technical side, oh, it's like 30 characters, but over there you can just type 10, but other places, five characters. So for me, I feel like that's what makes me not sleep. I think it's a good idea.
00:15:54
To some extent, we're kind of trying to solve it with ELT right now, and that might help us understand how to do it on the other side. There are products like Vintelligence, which is a Vint decoder, so you get a Vint, and we know that this is a Toyota Corolla. Not all Vints are decodable, so there's kind of an 80-20 rule or something in there around that range.
00:16:08
Those are good answers. I appreciate that.
00:16:10
It appears to be such a good product. Why do we have so many hurdles to be accepting such a large market? That's John asking the question on the chat.
00:16:18
Well, if you want a full explanation, I would refer that to ELT or the sales team, but generally, contracts with Facebook are really slow, and I don't know that it's always the case. But in the case, in the state that we've been in, we wouldn't go in and deploy just a dealer solution by itself. There has to be an understanding by the government agency that they're going to accept those submissions, and obviously, we need to connect to some other system, the receiving system on the V&V side. So there's a lot of moving parts, I would say, in complexity, but of the states that we are looking to make contracts in, you have ETRS, and that product is very sought after. So I would imagine that there's going to be a lot more states using it here soon. Is ETRS kind of what you would say, like, the initial part of a land and expand, typically, like, strategically?
00:16:51
You could say that, yeah. One approach is to go into a state with no technology and launch an ERT system and then expand that to ELT, then expand that to digital title, for example. That's what we did in West Virginia. Other states, I mean, it depends. New Jersey is a good example of one where we started with ELT versus ERT, but one of those two is typically the best candidates to kind of start with, because it's easy to transition from paper to that world versus jumping from paper to that world across.
00:17:08
Was that Miguel. 
00:17:10
In your perspective, what challenges do you need help on today, and how might internal teams or people that have interests or ideas collaborate with you impactfully? Just because we're so far away. So for those who didn't hear, the question from Matt was essentially, what are we looking to do? What challenges are we facing? And internally speaking, any interested parties, how might they reach out? How might they help solve those problems. 
00:17:31
Have you seen any thoughts on the Clearinghouse side? So from my end, just communicate. Come up to me, Adam. Gian is also the tech for Clearinghouse. Bring up suggestions, send a message in Slack, or just if you're in an office, come up and tell us your thoughts. If you haven't tried out the test environments, I do suggest going in there and test out both the Clearinghouse log-in and the STEM log-in in the test environments to see how they work. Because it's always good to exercise on everything. Yeah. Cool.
00:17:57
Tell me if you turned the mic off. Yeah, that's what I was going to do. No, actually, it's the TV.
00:18:01
Well, no, we did a TV that wouldn't hear the echo. So do Matt's audio, and then we won't hear it.
00:18:05
Matt's audio? Sorry, there's a big head on the screen. Maybe I should stop sharing the screen here. One second. Too many screens.
00:18:13
Testing. OK. Yeah.
00:18:15
Sorry.
00:18:15
Yep, we can hear you.
00:18:16
OK, I thought you guys were just ignoring Shane. And then I tried to talk, and I thought you weren't. Well, I'm so sorry.
00:18:19
Well, if Shane was talking, we would turn the audio on soon.
00:18:22
The only thing I was going to chime in on Miguel's answer is sometimes a state, right. They have legislators that make mandates, right? Like, so we go into a state that we would like to deploy, let's say the ERT solution, but they've mandated ELT by a certain date. Right. So we're not always able to kind of dictate the product we deploy first. Sometimes we are deploying a product that has been mandated by legislation.
00:18:39
Thank you.
00:18:42
I'm glad to hear I wasn't being ignored. I was slightly confused. But no, all I was saying was I liked your answers to what keeps you up at night. And I think one of the things we bring to the market that other companies don't, and it's one of the things that probably allows us to grow faster than others, is that, yes, we need all the data to be consistent. But what we need the states to do is to feel like they have their autonomy, and they define what they need to define. And then in the background, we're the ones making it consistent so that, you know, if they've got a different number of characters in one state versus another, that's fine. But we figure out how to make it consistent in the background so that we know there's a very consistent discipline process for those APIs to work from place to place to place. And so there's obviously nuance between state to state, but that's sort of the genius of what y'all are creating is that it's very user friendly.
00:19:26
And we always keep that top of mind and that the user's needs are top of mind. But we have to make it consistent in the back end, then we'll have a product that really wins the day. And yeah, this is really good. I'm impressed by what y'all put together.
00:19:37
Thank you. Very well said. I agree. Yes, Alex? Well, I may be oversimplifying this, but is the implementation of the headless API less complex than the traditional UI implementation? And is that something you can look forward to? No, we want to get that one.
00:19:49
Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry.
00:19:51
So a question for those on Zoom and also Naomi. Alex's question is, is a headless implementation kind of like what we did in Kentucky, simpler than a UI implementation of ETS. 
00:19:59
That's a really technical question. I have to be forwarded to the tech people during, I guess. I don't know. You can answer. I don't know.
00:20:04
I'll say, at least from a product sense, yes, because oftentimes when there's a UI, there's specific requirements the state wants. For example, there's a field in West Virginia that we at one point called, it was essentially like a loan or a lease price, rather, the total price you pay for your lease. They call that cap cost reduction. So at some point, they asked us to tweak that field name specifically for them to show cap cost reduction. We did that entirely on the UI. So to our system, we still call it whatever it was originally. But there's always that level of, we actually want this button to be green and we want our icon to be this size. And versus an API, they sort of press a button and things work. There's less things to apply on. So yes and no depends on the state, but generally.
00:20:35
Thank you. Yeah.
00:20:38
Anybody else have any other questions. 
00:20:39
It's great how Clearinghouse is expanding. More service providers means more potential growth. What is the onboarding process like for a Clearinghouse service provider. 
00:20:47
I can honestly say I've not been any part of the onboarding.
00:20:52
Maybe Dan works with us. Dan will say, here's our swagger, here's the APIs, here's how you can use them, here's the SIP environment, go ahead and do your testing. And then once they get approval, then you go ahead and test.
00:21:02
What's the length of time that that typically takes? It's a range. Good question.
00:21:06
Yeah, it could probably be done in a few weeks. It's like our certification, we say, okay, you're now certified, here's your confidentiality.
00:21:18
It's similar to ELT. All right.
00:21:20
All right, quick time check. We are a couple minutes over. If you want to hold anyone, if there are any other questions, you can hang around. But once again, thank you all for joining. We will be back next week with part two of four. And we look forward to it. Thanks, all.

## Summary
This lecture, delivered on 2026-01-26, is the first in a four-part product showcase series introducing the company’s suite of DMV-related products, with a focus on ERT (Electronic Registration and Titling), ETRS (Electronic Title Registration Service), and Clearinghouse. It explains the traditional paper-based vehicle titling workflow and how ERT modernizes it by transmitting data electronically between dealers and DMVs, significantly reducing cycle times from weeks to same-day approvals. The session details ETRS implementations in West Virginia (launched Q4 2021, >500,000 transactions) and Kentucky (launched Q2 2024, >5,000 transactions), integrations with vendors (e.g., Tyler Tech, V2), and UI vs. headless API approaches. It also covers Clearinghouse, a national digital clearinghouse that enables non-resident businesses to obtain same-day West Virginia titles from anywhere in the U.S., standardizing requirements, fees, and timelines across states. Future directions include a Digital Title Vault, a global ERT gateway, increased service provider activation, and deeper automation via internal systems (e.g., Comms and Cade). The team emphasizes challenges such as standardizing transaction sets and data fields across states, legislative mandates affecting product rollout order, and internal collaboration needs.
## Knowledge Points
### 1. Showcase Series Overview and Team
* Product Showcase Schedule
   - Four sessions over four weeks cover the company’s product suite and how systems connect, data flows, and supporting systems interplay.
   - Session topics: Today: ETRS and Clearinghouse; 2026-02-06: Retos and Cade; 2026-02-14: ELTS and Comms; 2026-02-19: DTS (capstone), scheduled just before Thanksgiving (context in original narrative).
* Goals and Audience Knowledge
   - Objective is to build foundational knowledge on each app: what they do, who uses them, problems solved, and market fit.
   - Internal knowledge gaps acknowledged; the series aims to help the entire company better understand products to enable scaling and market growth.
* Presenters and Roles
   - Product and design team members will present across sessions; Maria is highlighted for designing all apps.
   - Specific participants mentioned: Tyler (Speaker 1), Naomi (Speaker 2, product owner for ETRS), Christine (Speaker 4, speaks on Clearinghouse), Miguel, Dan, Shane, Alex, Matt, Blaise, and others contributing via questions and chat monitoring.
### 2. Paper-Based Titling Process vs. ERT
* Traditional Paper Process
   - Dealer collects and mails paper documents (title application, lien info) to DMV; mailroom sorting leads to delays; reviews can take days; missing documents trigger mail-backs causing additional delays.
   - Cycle times vary widely; commonly 30+ days; certain states specify deadlines (e.g., 60, 90 days) yet actual durations depend on backlogs (e.g., USPS, DMV workload).
   - Example: In West Virginia, point-of-sale to paper title delivery was “north of 40 days” at one time.
* ERT Definition and Benefits
   - ERT (Electronic Registration and Titling) transmits required title/registration data electronically from dealers to states, eliminating repeated paper exchanges.
   - Industry context: Introduced in early 2000s; ELT referenced as analogous industry term; eSTART (industry coalition) cited as a resource explaining ERT.
   - Benefits observed: DMVs can approve in real time; customers can effectively receive approvals same day when submissions are complete and pass checks.
### 3. ETRS (Electronic Title Registration Service)
* Implementations and Partners
   - States live: West Virginia and Kentucky (blue-highlighted in internal maps); additional prospective states indicated (lighter blue).
   - West Virginia launched Q4 2021; vendor integration includes Tyler Tech (assistant vendor/third-party); dealers log into VRS (Vehicle Registration System) and use a dealer portal UI to upload evidentiary documents before submitting to the state.
   - Kentucky launched Q2 2024; >5,000 transactions to date; uses a headless API approach (no dealer portal UI) to submit electronic information to the DMV; vendors include V2 and Tyler Tech.
* Volumes and Adoption
   - West Virginia: a little over 500,000 transactions processed up to date (as of session date).
   - Kentucky: a little over 5,000 transactions up to date (as of session date), reflecting newer launch and growth trajectory.
* Dealer Portal and Digital Title Vault
   - Dealer portal fills functional gaps in West Virginia and supports future enhancements in prospective states.
   - Digital Title Vault is under active development (work ongoing “literally as of this morning”) to enable dealer interactions with digital titles via the ETRS portal; more details planned in later sessions.
* Global ERT Gateway Vision
   - Current state: service providers must integrate with each ERT-supporting state individually (many-to-one, 50 integrations if 50 states).
   - ELT precedent: a global ELT gateway provides a single integration, routing by state to appropriate agencies, reducing reintegration burden and enabling standardized processes.
   - Future extension: adopt the global gateway concept for ERT—service providers integrate once with the company’s gateway, which routes to DMVs based on state, simplifying updates and standardizing workflows.
### 4. Clearinghouse (National Digital Clearinghouse)
* Purpose and Scope
   - Enables non-resident businesses (NRBs) to obtain a West Virginia title from anywhere in the U.S. the same day, replicating ETRS benefits for out-of-state use cases.
   - Solves complexities of multi-state operations: varying requirements, forms, fees, and unpredictable cycle times; standardizes these to predictable same-day turnaround.
* Business Impact and Fee Variability
   - Example fee differences: Ohio $15 vs. New Jersey $60; planning across 10–20 states becomes complex and costly; Clearinghouse alleviates fee unpredictability by standardizing the process and timeline.
   - Cycle time improvement: previously 2 to 60 days; with Clearinghouse, perfect applications submitted in the morning can yield titles by end of day (within about six hours), delivered as digital or paper.
* Process and Key Players
   - External key players: the client party seeking the title; service providers (largest mentioned: DDI) who help submit applications; DMV (West Virginia) that accepts/rejects applications.
   - Internal key players: systems in use (currently “S10,” moving to “KdenCost” in future—names as stated), dev team, client operations, QA, and broader internal groups contributing to Clearinghouse functionality.
   - Submission flow: NRB submits application via headless API; data goes into internal systems (e.g., “S10”), then to DMV leveraging DTS; titles returned within six hours as digital or paper.
* Status and Growth
   - Clearinghouse started mid-year last year; initially had one service provider that is no longer in business; only a couple hundred transactions at start.
   - This year: increased number of service providers and transactions; aiming to grow volume (not yet near ETRS’s half-million but trending upward).
* Differentiation from Other Clearinghouses
   - Other national clearinghouse offerings (only one known competitor) are reportedly more manual and rely on partnering with a dealership acting in-state.
   - This product partners directly with the government/DMV, enabling potential full automation and real-time approvals (subject to DMV approval and passing checks), and aligns with a digital title strategy.
* Use Cases and Output
   - Typical scenario: A national dealer (e.g., Carvana) acquires a vehicle in Arizona and wants the title in its name quickly to resell. Instead of waiting 2–60 days in Arizona, they obtain a same-day West Virginia title via Clearinghouse, then sell outside West Virginia.
   - Clarification: Input vehicles can originate from any state; output is always a West Virginia title. Preference is not to use Clearinghouse for West Virginia-to-West Virginia titling.
### 5. Technical Approaches and Challenges
* UI vs. Headless API
   - Headless API implementations (e.g., Kentucky ETRS, Clearinghouse) reduce UI-specific demands (custom field labels, styling preferences) and can simplify deployments from a product perspective.
   - UI implementations (e.g., West Virginia dealer portal) often require state-specific UI customizations (e.g., renaming a field to “cap cost reduction,” button styling), adding complexity.
* Standardization Across States
   - ETRS challenge: defining and standardizing the “master set” of dealer transactions across states (e.g., title applications, salvage, duplicate titles, dealer assignments), similar to ELT’s standard set (~15 transactions).
   - Data consistency hurdles: differing field constraints across states (e.g., varying character limits). The team aims to maintain back-end consistency while respecting state autonomy and front-end requirements.
   - Tools and related products: Vintelligence (VIN decoder) helps identify vehicle details (e.g., Toyota Corolla) but not all VINs are decodable; an 80/20-type limitation applies.
* Legislative and Contractual Realities
   - State legislatures may mandate product priorities (e.g., ELT by a certain date), influencing rollout order; sometimes ELT precedes ERT.
   - Contracting with state agencies is slow and requires agency buy-in and integration with state receiving systems; strategy can be “land and expand” (start with ERT or ELT, then extend to digital titles).
* Service Provider Onboarding
   - Onboarding steps: provide swagger and API documentation; grant access to a staging (“SIP”) environment; service providers perform testing; certification occurs upon approval; then production access.
   - Typical timelines: can be completed in a few weeks; process similar to ELT certification.
   - Growth aim: Increasing active, educated service providers to drive transaction volume and revenue.
### 6. Collaboration, Testing, and Internal Systems
* Internal Collaboration Requests
   - Encouragement to communicate ideas via Slack or in-person; suggestions to test in the environments (Clearinghouse login and system login) to understand flows; exercise systems and provide feedback.
* Systems Mentioned
   - Current/internal systems: “S10” (in use for Clearinghouse), moving to “KdenCost” in the future; DTS referenced as part of DMV utilization flow.
   - Upcoming sessions will detail Comms and Cade, which are key to achieving greater automation for Clearinghouse.
* User-Centric Design with Back-End Consistency
   - Leadership perspective: States should retain autonomy on defining needs; the company ensures consistent back-end discipline so APIs work uniformly across states despite front-end differences (e.g., varying field sizes), maintaining a user-friendly experience.
