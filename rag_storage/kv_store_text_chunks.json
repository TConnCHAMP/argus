I forget which one exactly.\nSpeaker 1 00:02:29\nLouisiana's the big one she's doing now.\nSpeaker 2 00:02:31\nOkay, do you find those are mostly at the state level or are you performing those also with like the individual dealerships or maybe smaller entities. \nSpeaker 1 00:02:43\nso it just depends um probably not usually with the smaller entities okay we those will might get involved later so we've got different products so our like the louisiana is our id driver's ids you know so potentially um that's almost all state now we have to integrate with a million other people and so we've got like a team there's a group called amva which is an association of motor vehicle administrators they basically represent all the.\nSpeaker 1 00:03:16\nstate dmvs and they've got a number of systems that like okay if you know somebody you revoke someone's license in louisiana you got to let all the other states know this you know so they've got services you have to call so we've got a whole team that's just working on those updates you, know and then we've got another team that's just working on all the state, in-state integrations like well the court system the court sends you this person you know had a dui you have to you know that has to get applied to their license um so we've got teams working with.\nSpeaker 1 00:03:48\nthat um but then we have we have another product so we've got a bunch of products like that like the driver's id vehicle titling registration that are all kind of geared our main customer is the state dmv then we have another some other products we've got one called um elt which is electronic liens and titles which is for the banks so the bank wants their you pay off your loan they want the lien removed from your title they they can electronically send it to us we'll route it to the.\nSpeaker 1 00:04:23\nthing so our main customer there's really the the lenders and they have their service providers that kind of do this work for the lenders you know and so we will have sessions with them, mostly those service providers saying here's how you call our apis and stuff like that okay and.\nSpeaker 2 00:04:43\nthen abby was mentioning and i absolutely have the took the same approach with my recent product um the apis you guys are looking to uh v2 the apis make them more robust is that accurate is that.\nSpeaker 1 00:04:58\nyeah it's really it's more than the apis it's like on some of these we've got um like our initial product that we did back four years ago is when i first started um we redid the vehicle titling, registration license plates for west virginia okay they were kind of our they were our first one that's all from scratch you know did all that it was not written in a way that we can easily take that to another state sure we tried we had ideas but you know once we got to the second state.\nSpeaker 1 00:05:33\nwe're like yeah this this is not",

Yeah. There's so many things going on, we've got so many states that we're trying to do, and they all.\nSpeaker 2 00:06:28\nSounds like a good kind of busy though, right. \nSpeaker 1 00:06:30\nYeah, I mean it's fun, because they, we're doing well, I mean everybody seems to like us, and we. You know, New Jersey was, they were our first ELT customer, well, other than West Virginia. And they want to do a phase two where they bring and basically do all the vehicle, the titling and that. And that's going to involve the dealers. Now, this will be one that will involve dealers because they want to be able to have dealers submit the transfer agreements electronically.\nSpeaker 1 00:07:00\nGot it.\nSpeaker 2 00:07:00\nReally slim up and speed up that process then, I assume.\nSpeaker 1 00:07:03\nYeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, I'm trying to think what else. Yeah, so, I mean, we've got, they want to, like I said, they want to do a phase two. We do ELT in Illinois. They want to do dealer submissions in Illinois. There's just, yeah, so much.\nSpeaker 2 00:07:24\nYeah. Now, are you, I don't believe this role is actively filled, correct? When it comes to an on-site or a JAD, is that something you typically are attending? Is that an Abby thing. \nSpeaker 1 00:07:36\nSo it's, I mean, Abby's been attending them. So in the way I'm trying to, when I heard about this role, this product architect role, I was trying to figure out a way, one, for me to understand it, and two, for everybody else, for me to tell everybody else how it works. And so what I've been kind of in my mind thinking is that if you, on a spectrum of business to technical, you've got like Abby as a business person, and then you, and then on my side,\nSpeaker 1 00:08:08\nwe're going to hire a solution architect, which is kind of like going to be right in the middle, and then the enterprise architects, and then the engineering.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:16\nAwesome. Yep.\nSpeaker 1 00:08:18\nThat makes sense. That actually helps out that spectrum helps out quite a bit. So are you actively hiring for that solution architect perspective? Is that okay? Yeah. So I've got two, I've got me and I'm still doing enterprise architect work. I'm trying to get myself out of that just because there's so much going on and I can't stay on top of what I need to do. Sure. But I've got two other enterprise architects that work for me. And then right now I've got a data, I've got the data team under me, although that may be changing. I'll keep a data architect.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:49\nProbably move the data engineers out from underneath me. Sure. Yeah, it was it was interesting talking with Abby about how, how new this role is, or this concept, you know, so it was, it seemed like a good fit. It seems like I have a lot to bring to the offering here. So it Yeah, it definitely does. I mean, it's something we've every thing we've gone into, basically, it's been.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:17\nMe or Bo, who's our CTO, or there's another guy, Ian, who he runs, like, he's the VP in charge of, like, state implementations.\nSpeaker 3 00:09:28\nYeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:29\nSo versus, like, we now have a VP over product, over, like, I'm sorry, Abby's filling that VP of product. There's, like, a VP of engineering, which is really the product engineering. And then there's Ian, who's over the VP of, you know, the implementations of our products in the states. Almost like a services.\nSpeaker 2 00:09:50\nWe refer to those as services almost for the implementations.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:53\nYeah, I mean, the one difference that we've tried to",

I work very closely with Britt, yeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:10:06\nYeah, so, I mean, she's our new VP of engineering. Okay, great. So she and I were talking this week. She just started this. She just started this week. And. It sounded like with OnBase that it was much more customizable per state. It was super customizable. We actually are actively trying to avoid doing that. We're trying to go more the SAP model. Look, our process, not just our software, but our process is better than what you've got.\nSpeaker 1 00:10:39\nSo just use what we've got. We'll integrate with everything you have. We'll do everything that we have to do statutorily. But we don't want this thing to look that much different in New Jersey than it does in West Virginia. It should be pretty much the same product. So that's what the state implementation team's job is to do. We have what we call state plugins. Basically, that's where we abstract out whatever, like either specific logic or the way we display something that has to happen in that state.\nSpeaker 1 00:11:14\nThat's what we use. And that's really where the state implementation lives. that or at least all of this take all of this with a grain of salt because they're so busy this is very informative for me so yeah but the plan is that state implementation team basically owns the state plugins and then the engineering team owns the product so state plugin team might say oh hey we just did this for new jersey it'd be really helpful in all of the states to have this.\nSpeaker 1 00:11:46\ngo back to the engineering team they build it into the product sure then you know yeah i i like.\nSpeaker 2 00:11:53\nI really like your concept of being a little bit more opinionated with the workflow step.\nSpeaker 1 00:11:59\nYeah.\nSpeaker 2 00:11:60\nBecause, I mean, that is a downfall of, I wouldn't say downfall, but it is a complex point of the on-base schema is the fact that you can, there's a lot of checks and balances and sometimes they are failing because it is so customizable.\nSpeaker 1 00:12:16\nYeah. So, I mean, and again, there's different ways to do it. This is just the way we chose to do it. Sure.\nSpeaker 2 00:12:25\nOh, yeah. Now, how much of this V2 or Vnext is in place today. \nSpeaker 1 00:12:36\nSo, like I said, it depends which product we're talking about. The VTOS, which is our titling. registration module yeah that's the one that needs that's the one we originally wrote for west virginia and needs to get redone you're right we've created a second version of it but it's really slimmed out because one of the things we we moving towards so like elts which is our like i said the one that talks to lenders yep it it needs to know about titles so that it can remove.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:09\na lien from the title sure well we had kind of a bastardized way of doing it and we didn't like it so what we've said is well we'll put a vtas everywhere we put elts we'll put a headless, there's no ui for it okay its job basically is to manage the titles and then the other thing it does it knows whether or not we're the system of record or the state's the system of record, so like in illinois we are not the system of record right so but we're gonna have a vtas there.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:40\nthat kind of just, ELT knows how to talk to VITAS. VITAS says, oh, this is not, I don't know this. I need to go talk to the state and get it from their mainframe. Got it. Okay. To pull it back. So we've gotten that version of, which is the next version of VITAS there. What we need to do is basically build the, when we are the system of record, we need to build all that into it. Okay. Okay. So.\nSpeaker 2 00:14:03\nyou had that V1 with West Virginia. V1.5 is deployed in a couple other states, alongside one. And now you're looking V2 isn't necessarily built yet, but you're looking to do that in a scalable manner. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That helps out a lot.\nSpeaker 1 00:14:29\nUm, anything else I can answer for you or, I mean, I've, I've, I think you're a really good fit for this, by the way, so.\nSpeaker 2 00:14:37\nOh, good, yeah. No, I, I appreciate the, I, I appreciate the context, because I, I thought I had a great conversation with Abby, that was, uh, felt like a good fit there, um, so I did, you know, the opportunity here",

But we are kind of at that transition phase from kind of the founder-led concept and product where... where it wasn't our founder it was our cto but he definitely drove the product roadmap it was very much okay here's what you're going to do go build it go build it this exact way you know all of that um we're shifting to product led so it is we're in a transition period so it's.\nSpeaker 1 00:01:45\na little bit of growing pains for some of our product members who are stepping into that role but i think it's not a really exciting opportunity to be very uh product led um while we have state contracts that we need to like build to uh we also get to kind of own that road map and figure out where we're taking the books and there's a number of zero to one opportunities that we have as well as growing our existing um that to say there's a lot of different opportunities.\nSpeaker 1 00:02:17\num and we're kind of just bringing folks on sometimes we'll bring them on to a very specific team sometimes we'll just bring them on and figure out what team makes sense for them, but i know there's there's another role that i wanted to kind of talk to a few about that i want to hear a little bit about what you're looking for first before um before i kind of get down to that potential side track so i would love to hear a little bit about your background and really what you're looking for in your next role yeah.\nSpeaker 2 00:02:46\nabsolutely so i i'm currently a product manager at highland software um and so your your comment around you know cto led um transitioning more product led resonated with me it's uh you're pretty sure the choir on that one so i've been here for 12 13 years now it's it's been my fresh out of college i was an intern i actually interned within our development our engineering department, it's where i got my job kind of got my start my my i have that mindset if you use our import.\nSpeaker 2 00:03:20\nexport ui for on base that was handcrafted by me in my lakewood apartment back in the day so, It was kind of a natural fit, you know, Hyland went through a bunch of acquisitions, which brought up this concept of product. So as I, you know, I'm very customer facing, I found I really enjoyed being able to see and hear and listen to what the customers like, and more importantly, what they don't like, what's not working for them. And I was, I found enjoyment, I found a lot of excellence, it fit me very well to bring that back to the team.\nSpeaker 2 00:03:60\nAnd so that it was a natural fit for product. And whether that was product owner at first, and you know, we've shifted at Hyland to all product management. And then recently, they shifted me, I think, in the last two years into this AI space. And it's been a good, natural fit for kind of my engineering mindset. I find myself on a weekly, if not daily basis, kind of brainstorming, proof of concepting, using some of these new technologies alongside our sales department to really be able to demonstrate and showcase what we have here.\nSpeaker 2 00:04:35\nat Highlands. It's been fun. Yeah, I bet. What are you looking for next? Yeah, so I've been with Highlands for a little while, so I've seen it kind of in all of those different stages and phases. One of the most, I can't seem to think of the right word, one of the most validating pieces, one of my favorite parts of my job was going from that zero to ten. I don't want to call it a specialty of mine, but I've brought three or four different product offerings up from a thought on a whiteboard.\nSpeaker 2 00:05:11\nThat's back when we would whiteboard through that customer validation phase, through the actual initial proof of concept. I've become the advocate for it. I'm able to kind of push my passion for the product onto some of our customers who may not understand what we're trying to build and really bring it to the market. I've done that quite a few times here. My most recent is through our knowledge discovery offering, which I did within nine months, ten months, alongside the engineering team.\nSpeaker 2 00:05:41\nWe had something that was actually tangible and being able to be sold, more importantly, as we kind of iterated through the wants and needs of our user base or our target user base",

So yeah, all that being said, that's kind of what I'm looking for next. We've gotten maybe a little bit more. More. uh, official with some of the layers of leadership that are, are being included here at Highland recently. Um, it's exceedingly difficult to get new feature, actual wants and needs from our customers.\nSpeaker 2 00:06:17\npassed and actually approved in some sense, um, simply because of the different layers of the, the cake or the onion per se. Um, so that's kind of what I'm looking for next is maybe a new opportunity to, to get back to my, my roots of, of just bringing product to the market based on customer's needs, based on what the market's looking for, um, and help kind of grow that, uh, grow that together with engineering.\nSpeaker 1 00:06:42\nSo, um, I know your, your resume and your, uh, linkedin profiles very specific to ai are you specifically looking for that or is that just, kind of recent is kind of where the market is going so i understand that but.\nSpeaker 2 00:06:60\nyeah i'm not locked into ai uh at this point in time um it was you know the majority of my career i was a c-sharp developer um if not then we shifted into angular before i jumped into um angular react um i was pulled from that team and kind of directed towards this this ai initiative so i made the most of it um i made it my personality per se um but you know there's nothing stopping me from from doing that again you know i think.\nSpeaker 2 00:07:33\ni see a real tangible value in a lot of the ai tech out there um and it's uh it's kind of shown me and really helped me uh grow and and learn how how to apply, that to some of the customer bases so, Yeah, not locked into AI at this point. I'm definitely open to learning more and seeing where I fit in.\nSpeaker 1 00:07:53\nAwesome. Well, I know you answered a lot of questions from the team, and I've reviewed their notes, so I really wanted to open it up to you first and see what other questions you might have.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:08\nYeah, Sarah just mentioned that this was kind of a new opportunity from the outsider in, trying to understand kind of where this is, this conversation fits in with what I was doing with them. Just trying to get a lay of the land for what you're looking for, what you're thinking.\nSpeaker 1 00:08:27\nYeah, so as I mentioned, our team is growing rapidly, and we're still trying to figure out the right structure. So right now we have in place the, I'm not sure, did you meet with? All three leads, Tony, Tyler, and Jackie.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:43\nAbsolutely, yeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:08:46\nso they're kind of starting to lead sections of our business um and they are all looking for a product manager or a senior product manager um but then in addition i have two other kind of roles i've been trying to figure out what i'm going to do with yeah um one is we actually just posted and i'm really curious what i'm going to get out in the market um is what we're calling a product architect okay and this is a unique role in that actually i have i have never worked.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:19\nwith a role like this before it's kind of a um a test for us but really one of the problems we're running into is we have a huge gap between our product, side of the business and our architecture and data side of the business okay, And this role first will kind of help bridge that gap. So we're looking for someone who has both the technical chops as well as the desire to understand the business and the user.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:52\nWe're building what we call a unified data model, so that all of our products will use. Previously, kind of in that startup mentality, it was just like build to get it out. Now it's build to scale. But what's really important is we spend a lot of time working with our states and our users to understand both their business needs and the ideal user experience and build the data model to fit that kind of scalability. So a lot of that work up to this point has been myself and our CTO kind of going in.\nSpeaker 1 00:10:24\nYou know, he has the technical mind. I come from a design background, so I have more of a user. And it's us going back and forth to decide kind of what this data model looks like. Also understanding that each state kind of handles the data model. So that's one of the things that we're building. things differently. I think examples are really good because this was new to me. I worked in previously in more traditional B2B SaaS where you build the product and they are going to either use it or not. Versus this, we have our core product and then we have state plugins because.\nSpeaker 1 00:10:56\neach state does things differently. So one good example is we're building our credentialing product right now to manage driver licenses. And we're working first with",

So one good example is we're building our credentialing product right now to manage driver licenses. And we're working first with the state of Louisiana. The state of Louisiana is a multi-credential state. So you can have both a state ID and a driver's license. And if you have a handicap, that's a whole separate printed card. Now in other states, you have one and then you could have what's called a handicap permit or that.\nSpeaker 1 00:11:30\nlike hang tag that you're used to seeing in cars. so we had to sit there and think like okay so in louisiana this is a credential, but in our next state this is going to be a permit sure how do we build the data model to support that in the right way and then where do we put in the state plug-in because our users are expecting it to work as a credential in this state we don't want to like completely change their world because this change management's really big in our system sure so we had to kind of really think through.\nSpeaker 1 00:12:05\ntheir needs their business and the technology to figure out like okay we came to the agreement that it's going to be in the permit data model and the permit tables but on the ui in the state plug-in we're going to say treat this permit like it's a credential interesting okay, so those types of things like we need someone like myself and our cto can't be the bottleneck yeah um so we're i'm trying kind of to replace both of our brains yeah to be able to go in and.\nSpeaker 1 00:12:37\nunderstand the business needs and the users needs and then bring it back to our data team and our engine our um we have an enterprise architecture team and then a data team and there there's a a gap in their ability to go to a state they don't want to be customer facing and so instead like yeah you know start to build that gap of now i'm constantly having to bring what we're hearing from our users to them translate it in a way and it's just it's slowing us down and yeah absolutely.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:12\num so i'm trying to kind of build this role to help bridge that gap but then also almost a product manager, for the data model, um because we have future use cases to um you know we need to start building the dashboard and reporting i'm going to need kind of that website to understand what they're looking for but then also help with translating that to the data team from a more technical need um.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:42\nand then we also have a future outlook of art are the data that we actually own we have, customers that would pay for that data sure so we have a whole product in and of itself that could so that's one of the roles that i'm trying to fill and then the other one is we have what we're calling value added that cross product so we have our three leads tony tyler and jackie that you met.\nSpeaker 1 00:14:23\nThey both own a piece of the business, so Jackie owns our vehicle side, so that's titling and registration, both from dealers submitting, lenders doing liens, and then the actual BMV or DMV, depending on the state, managing those titles. Again, I'm trying to keep it as high level so you don't get confused.\nSpeaker 2 00:14:45\nOh, this is great. Yeah, great information, too.\nSpeaker 1 00:14:47\nYeah, so she owns that side. Tony is owning our credentialing side, so the one I just talked about, so building that zero to one, we're launching that in September. Okay. Never been built before. The state actually signed a contract with us to do that, but that's huge, and that's a really big piece. And then Tyler owns our digital side, so we're actually trying to launch digital titles instead of a paper title. But on top of that, we have things.\nSpeaker 1 00:15:19\nThat's what we're from. so a good example is we want to build a fees engine so that there's so many times that we have to generate fees and we've been actually using a partner to help drive that which we're trying to get away from that partnership but there's so many intricacies when it comes to fees and the state needs so we kind of want to build this core fees engine that we can then put.\nSpeaker 1 00:15:51\nthat state plug-in on for like skews so we need to kind of build something like that um there are other value ads um that kind of cross that platform that's very zero to one very r d at this point so i'm looking for uh potentially a role to help kind of bring those to life, because it kind of crosses those three other roles, it wouldn't necessarily be under one of those roles or under those managers kind of sit off to the side. So those are both kind of roles.\nSpeaker 1 00:16:25\nI'm playing with. And I think it sounds like your background could really fit either of them in addition to any of the other product managers. So, you know, I think you seem to be the case where we would kind of bring in and feel where you would fit after getting onboarded. But, yeah, because of the constant change and the rapid growth, roles are very open. It's very much.\nSpeaker 1 00:16:56\nthe time to come into",

It's very much.\nSpeaker 1 00:16:56\nthe time to come into our organization and build your own role, like pave your own path. which is, I think, really exciting from a product management perspective. Like, you really can come in and find out, like, oh, you don't have an interest here. Like, I think I can carve this path for myself because it's so kind of unknown and growing.\nSpeaker 2 00:17:18\nSure. Yeah, that engineering lead product, did you have an official title for that first one. \nSpeaker 1 00:17:25\nI called it a product architect.\nSpeaker 2 00:17:27\nProduct architect, yeah. The way you described it is really interesting because... Like, I come from the configuration side of OnBase, which has to scale across all of these different verticals, organizations, government, not government, higher ed. So it's that, I'm just kind of brainstorming, thinking out loud, could that type of configuration experience also be applied here to some of the different types of credentialing, right? And then, of course, I'm a natural fit for customer facing. That's what I love.\nSpeaker 2 00:18:03\nI love seeing that spark go off in some of their eyes when I talk about it, or I like to see some of the passion in their eyes when they hate something. Recently, they highly put us through the Silicon Valley product group training for product management. How was that? I found a lot of value in it. Yeah? I've never had official product managers. I don't know if I should say that on an interview. I haven't either. Yeah. But it really refocused my thought process around problems.\nSpeaker 2 00:18:36\nYou know, what are the problem statements? Not necessarily, let's deliver this chunk of work, but why, you know, what is it solving? Which was oftentimes a artifact of that CTO driven, CEO driven experience. Yeah, I would highly recommend if you or the group have an opportunity to go through it. It was, I think it was a little costly. He came in, we did a couple of days. I think the cost was mostly on our time, but it was great. Yeah, highly recommended.\nSpeaker 1 00:19:07\nYeah, yeah, I know. I've seen them post those trainings and talk about them and I'm like, oh, God, that sounds awesome. But yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, I definitely want to look for opportunities to grow the team and continue to expand those. both the product side and kind of the collaboration and how the teams i love product, operating model concept of you know moving towards that three tiered product design and engineering.\nSpeaker 1 00:19:44\nlead yeah yeah all of that i would love to have our team do that yeah i started pulling in our.\nSpeaker 2 00:19:51\nour engineering one of my architects actually i started just pulling him into the calls based on on that you know even i'm trying to get us on site with a customer but his uh he's over in portugal so um it kind of makes the co-located teams a little bit difficult to manage so yeah that is.\nSpeaker 1 00:20:12\nHow do you feel about traveling if you were to go on-site to states? Would you be okay with that. \nSpeaker 2 00:20:17\nYeah, so currently I'm probably a once-a-quarter, twice-a-quarter type of travel right now. I'm definitely open to it. I have two kids at home. I take them to daycare. Days I don't take them to daycare, I hear about it from them, not even my wife. But I'm absolutely open to traveling and being able to be on-site and that sort of functionality.\nSpeaker 1 00:20:44\nYeah, I would expect that this product architect role would go into a lot of our kickoffs. So we typically do an on-site kickoff with the state to understand. We do what we call JAD sessions, joint architecture design, so that was new to me when I started here. I had never heard it called that. but we do that with them to understand kind of their business their needs what they call different things and then that's how we kind of start the product design and figuring out what that state.\nSpeaker 1 00:21:22\nplugin is we're moving a lot of our key products to a gen 2 right now getting away from the very highly state specific versions that we did in the beginning to this larger scalable model, so we're really that's kind of all of 2026 is going to be what i've been coining the phrase, building the launch pad.\nSpeaker 1 00:21:52\nSo we've really kind of identified the rocket, but we need to set the foundation and make it scalable. We need to get some of our R&D products out to market and productized so we're ready to launch those with an additional state. So 2026 is really all about getting, taking care of a lot of that tech debt, really building this foundation of how do we build this product so it's scalable and it doesn't take a year and a half to onboard a state. It really should take, you know, six months.\nSpeaker 2 00:22:21",

That's the truth.\nSpeaker 1 00:22:34\nYeah, we have one state that should have launched two months ago and we've been ready this whole time, but it's really been on their end to do a lot of the integration testing and set up their sides. And it's just like, okay, like, we've been ready.\nSpeaker 2 00:22:49\nYeah, I get that.\nSpeaker 1 00:22:52\nso yeah but it's it's an interesting and it's an interesting time 2026 is going to be huge we have our ai product that we're trying to get out we're in a test and learn phase right now with that yeah um and then we need to actually bring that to market uh right now it's been kind of testing this one functionality to figure out the right way to do it but then you know we want by the end of 2026 to for that to be you know easily deployable to to our other states um same with.\nSpeaker 1 00:23:24\nour digital title so there's a lot of kind of understanding the the architecture and the needs and the states and really getting in and diving deep into that so sure yeah the data model aspect.\nSpeaker 2 00:23:37\nis it's it's a really interesting it's something i would yeah totally be interested in digging in and getting hands-on with i think that's really um, It's an interesting way to frame the position and the role. So, um, 80, what I, so my product right now, it's a knowledge discovery. You ask a question, you get an answer. 80% of that though, is based on the quality of the data that sits within our content lake, right? The quality and the standardization of the content that it can answer questions about.\nSpeaker 2 00:24:08\nUm, so even as it relates today, you know, it's not necessarily, it's, the solution architecture really that takes in the content, really standardize it, formats it, puts it in a way that's AI ready. Um, and then knowledge discovery, the, the, I don't want to say the easy part, but it's doing something with that after it's in a standard format is, is, is the bread and butter there.\nSpeaker 1 00:24:32\nSo, yeah, yeah, that's awesome.\nSpeaker 2 00:24:35\nI absolutely get the value behind wanting a standard, um, look feel for, for the data model itself.\nSpeaker 1 00:24:40\nSo it's tough, really tough, especially when it comes to. Thank you. Different states have different needs, and they can do things very differently. The vehicle side, so there's no, like, standardization when it comes to vehicle classes. You know, like, we'll get TOI for Toyota from one state in one dealer, and then the next dealer may send it over as TOIA. Sure. You know, that's one big thing that we need to be able to figure out on how we kind of standardize that, make kind of a canonicalized set of standards, and then be able to ingest that, because we're trying to build more of a global portal for our dealers so that...\nSpeaker 1 00:25:29\nYou don't have to have, you know, if you sell in both West Virginia and Kentucky, you don't have to have a West Virginia version and a Kentucky version. You can sign into one and then we kind of build that gateway in between so that they can use one. But the tough part is there's no standardization out there. So it's trying to figure out, like, what does that model look like and how do we handle that. \nSpeaker 2 00:25:51\nYeah. Now, is this product architect, is that leading a team? Is that reporting to you and CTO? What does that structure look like. \nSpeaker 1 00:26:02\nYeah. As of right now, it would be reporting to me, but then work very heavily with our architecture and data teams, really driving their. especially on the data side. Our data team, we're just starting to build out, but they're a bit young. So it would kind of work like a product manager would with their engineering lead and not managing, but really, you know, working together to drive that, yeah.\nSpeaker 2 00:26:29\nSure, that's something that I do, I excel at today, you know, and it all, I work very closely with. Unfortunately, fortunately, my engineering team is based in Poland. And so the engineering manager is sometimes my only, my time, you know, is, I work closely with him and then we have a real good collaboration. So that's nice to hear. Similar kind of setup, so.\nSpeaker 1 00:26:55\nYeah, yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, and then I don't know about",

It would sit outside of Tyler, Jackie, and Tony, so reporting directly into me. Okay, great, and then where do they report up.\nSpeaker 2 00:27:26\nthrough you as well, or do they report to CPO?

Yeah, I'm big in pushing our product designers to be very product focused and be, you know, doing a lot of the user research alongside the product managers. as i mentioned that's my background so i started as a product designer before i became a product manager so that is a really big focus for me i'm still heavily involved in the user experience in the ui of our portals and i'm i'm really trying to drive our product designers to be.\nSpeaker 1 00:28:29\nmore involved even in our headless api products because i think it's really important that our designers are ui designers our designers are really experienced designers and just because it's an api doesn't mean it can't um you know benefit from someone who's the voice of the.\nSpeaker 2 00:28:44\ncustomer and can understand that experience absolutely that's great to hear yeah i don't look at my my apis for knowledge discovery because they were they were crafted purely from the engineering standpoint and they uh while they are a product of ours it shows it so yeah that's.\nSpeaker 1 00:29:03\nanother reason why we're going to these gen twos of our apis because they originally were, get it done exactly you got to do that first and then you have to deal with the choices stabilize it out and make it yeah I assume this is in office you know.\nSpeaker 2 00:29:28\neveryone's downtown there that that office is there enough room I went in there with Sarah and I met with them in the office I was kind of like whoa.\nSpeaker 1 00:29:44\nopen space down below us on the first floor that we may look to take over as we we grow so great okay yeah yeah. Leadership keeps saying that they expect to double our company by the end of the next year, so we're going to go from 100 to 200 and not be surprised.\nSpeaker 2 00:30:01\nI believe it when it comes to, especially with all the news and hype I've been seeing. I'm a part of the Ohio X Group, a tech based out of Columbus, so Champ's always referenced within them.\nSpeaker 1 00:30:15\nYeah, we're excited about the growth, and Bo, our CTO, keeps saying that he wants to be the biggest software company in Ohio.\nSpeaker 2 00:30:25\nOkay, yeah. It'd be nice to, yeah. I'm all for that.\nSpeaker 1 00:30:33\nYeah, so does this product architect kind of role interest you, or would you prefer more of the product, like traditional product manager route. \nSpeaker 2 00:30:46\nI'm, especially in the ever-changing and ever-evolving landscape here, I'm not locked into a single title or a set of responsibilities. So with that in mind, yeah, absolutely. It's something I'm interested in. It's something that I think my experience aligns to pretty well already. Yeah. It could be a great fit here.\nSpeaker 1 00:31:09\nWith that said, I would like you to meet with either one of our architects, date a person or maybe both, if that's okay, just so that they can kind of get to know you. You've worked really well with them and they can do more of the technical. I am not technical. I can have a good conversation with an engineer, but that's where it ends.\nSpeaker 2 00:31:29\nSure, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So my last day for the year is Thursday. So if I need to come in, I should be available most of next week and the following.\nSpeaker 1 00:31:44\nOkay, yeah. I'll see you then. work with sarah to figure out who that next person would be but um i think it would be important just to double check the kind of your technical expertise because as much as i can ask about, i wouldn't know if you're right um i also will um send you we do have an actual job description for this so i'll send that to",

You know, you kind of, I love hearing people's backgrounds in product and figuring out, because.\nSpeaker 1 00:32:49\nno one, at least our age, went to school for product.\nSpeaker 2 00:32:52\nNo, yeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:32:53\nRight.\nSpeaker 2 00:32:55\nWell, I want to be a product manager when I grow up, Dad.\nSpeaker 1 00:33:01\nMaybe now, but.\nSpeaker 2 00:33:02\nYeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:33:02\nEven when I did a career day for my oldest son, and I didn't even bother talking about product management. I just did product design, because I'm like, they're not going to understand that. At least they can physically see the design piece of it.\nSpeaker 2 00:33:17\nMy kid thinks I build robots, because I'm in the AI space. He chats with my chatbot, and it's, yeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:33:26\nYeah, my kids just think I design apps, like games, on their phones. There you go, yeah. Sure. Kind of, yeah. Not quite as fun, but same concept. Yeah. Sidetracked. I don't remember where I was going with that, but...\nSpeaker 2 00:33:43\nYeah. No, I'm happy. I'm excited. Yeah, I would love to meet and chat some more, so... I'll have to scrape some of the dust off the engineering part of everything and see what I can come up with, so...\nSpeaker 1 00:33:56\nYeah, and then you can ask questions to more of our tech team, but in the product architect job description, it does list a little bit of tech stack that we use... Good, okay. ...so that you can kind of get an understanding of that. Obviously, we're not looking at someone who can write code, but someone who can at least understand the, you know, message queues and rabbit something.\nSpeaker 2 00:34:23\nOh, MQ. Yeah, I gotcha. Those are all technologies we use here today, so yeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:34:31\nYeah, it's all pretty standard, but all right, cool. Any other questions that you have for me. \nSpeaker 2 00:34:40\nNo, I appreciate the time and the ability to come in and kind of continue the conversation, so.\nSpeaker 1 00:34:47\nYeah, awesome. Well, I will, I'll touch base with Sarah. We'll be in touch with probably a final. Normally, I'm the final one, but if you have interest in this architect meeting, it would just be meeting our architect and design team members. Sure. And then I'll send you that job description so you can take a look at it. Yeah. After you meet with them, too, we can always have a conversation if you don't think that's right, and another product manager, you know, I don't think that's the end-all be-all if this role isn't the right one, so just keep that in mind as you talk to them, too.\nSpeaker 2 00:35:21\nAbsolutely. Yeah, I was going to mention, you know, if this isn't a good fit, I would love to just be included on anywhere that you can use help and assistance. You know, I have a particular, what's the, I have a particular set of skills, and I would love to use them with you guys, so.\nSpeaker 1 00:35:38\nYeah, awesome. Cool. Well, you'll hear from us soon, but if I don't speak to you specifically, I hope you have another nice holiday time off.\nSpeaker 2 00:35:49\nYes.\nSpeaker 1 00:35:51\nYeah, we'll go from there.\nSpeaker 2 00:35:52\nAbsolutely. You as well. Yeah, enjoy. Hopefully it's not too snowy where you're at, so.\nSpeaker 1 00:35:57\nNot too bad. I'm a west-sider, so.\nSpeaker 2 00:35:59\nOkay. I'm in Berea myself. I'm right by the airport, so.\nSpeaker 1 00:36:03\nToo bad. I'm in North Ridgeville.\nSpeaker 2 00:36:06\nOh, yeah. I grew up in Avon, so.\nSpeaker 1 00:36:09\nYeah. Yeah. I'm, uh, normally I'm in office, but my husband had surgery yesterday, so I'm remote. Oh yeah. Help him out. Yeah. Hopefully all goes well for you",

Usually the way, when we go into a new state, depending if it's a new product versus if it's one of our existing products that we're just doing an implementation with, but like on the existing ones, we'll go in and we kind of know the general structure of how our stuff's going to be. So it's about, okay, how do we plug your, you know, where are we plugging here?\nSpeaker 1 00:00:44\nWhat, you know, what limitations do you guys have? And usually it's things like, well, we don't have a unique ID for. a title sure or you know you know it's like okay well well we really need a unique idea how can we do this you know what can we come up with and that was kind of like because we had a one of the states where they're like well it changes it just it changes based on it's like well how can that title the title itself isn't changing it seems very immutable not immutable yeah what's the opposite of immutable mutable yeah and um you know and we'd have developers again yeah you know like.\nSpeaker 1 00:01:22\nlike your guy you dealt with you know he's been there for well this is how we've always done it we can't possibly have and it's like okay well let's stop and think about this maybe we can come on there's a will there's a way yeah somebody else well we could do that we could do that here and keep it mapped here to the old one yeah um but it's getting there and it turned into more you know two hours of them talking amongst themselves.\nSpeaker 2 00:01:47\nThat's sometimes, I prefer that sometimes because then I can be a fly on the wall per se.\nSpeaker 1 00:01:53\nYeah, because they've never even thought along these lines. So that's a lot of what this job involves is getting those conversations going and then capturing it all and bringing it back. So that then the architects can say, okay, here's how we can solve this technically.\nSpeaker 2 00:02:13\nAbsolutely, yeah. Yeah, now you guys, these sessions, these JAD sessions, when I was talking with Abby, it was mostly, I think her example was like Kentucky or Louisiana. I forget which one exactly.\nSpeaker 1 00:02:29\nLouisiana's the big one she's doing now.\nSpeaker 2 00:02:31\nOkay, do you find those are mostly at the state level or are you performing those also with like the individual dealerships or maybe smaller entities. \nSpeaker 1 00:02:43\nso it just depends um probably not usually with the smaller entities okay we those will might get involved later so we've got different products so our like the louisiana is our id driver's ids you know so potentially um that's almost all state now we have to integrate with a million other people and so we've got like a team there's a group called amva which is an association of motor vehicle administrators they basically represent all the.\nSpeaker 1 00:03:16\nstate dmvs and they've got a number of systems that like okay if you know somebody you revoke someone's license in louisiana you got to let all the other states know this you know so they've got services you have to call so we've got a whole team that's just working on those updates you, know and then we've got another team that's just working on all the state, in-state integrations like well the court system the court sends you this person you know had a dui you have to you know that has to get applied to their license um so we've got teams working with.\nSpeaker 1 00:03:48\nthat um but then we have we have another product so we've got a bunch of products like that like the driver's id vehicle titling registration that are all kind of geared our main customer is the state dmv then we have another some other products we've got one called um elt which is electronic liens and titles which is for the banks so the bank wants their you pay off your loan they want the lien removed from your title they they can electronically send it to us we'll route it to the.\nSpeaker 1 00:04:23\nthing so our main customer there's really the the lenders and they have their service providers that kind of do this work for the lenders you know and so we will have sessions with them, mostly those service providers saying here's how you call our apis and stuff like that okay and.\nSpeaker 2 00:04:43\nthen abby was mentioning and i absolutely have the took the same approach with my recent product um the apis you guys are looking to uh v2 the apis make them more robust is that accurate is that.\nSpeaker 1 00:04:58\nyeah it's really it's more than the apis it's like on some of these we've got um like our initial product that we did back four years ago is when i first started um we redid the vehicle titling, registration license plates for west virginia okay they were kind of our they were our first one that's all from scratch you know did all that it was not written in a way that we can easily take that to another state sure we tried we had ideas but you know once we got to the second state.\nSpeaker",

Yeah. There's so many things going on, we've got so many states that we're trying to do, and they all.\nSpeaker 2 00:06:28\nSounds like a good kind of busy though, right. \nSpeaker 1 00:06:30\nYeah, I mean it's fun, because they, we're doing well, I mean everybody seems to like us, and we. You know, New Jersey was, they were our first ELT customer, well, other than West Virginia. And they want to do a phase two where they bring and basically do all the vehicle, the titling and that. And that's going to involve the dealers. Now, this will be one that will involve dealers because they want to be able to have dealers submit the transfer agreements electronically.\nSpeaker 1 00:07:00\nGot it.\nSpeaker 2 00:07:00\nReally slim up and speed up that process then, I assume.\nSpeaker 1 00:07:03\nYeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, I'm trying to think what else. Yeah, so, I mean, we've got, they want to, like I said, they want to do a phase two. We do ELT in Illinois. They want to do dealer submissions in Illinois. There's just, yeah, so much.\nSpeaker 2 00:07:24\nYeah. Now, are you, I don't believe this role is actively filled, correct? When it comes to an on-site or a JAD, is that something you typically are attending? Is that an Abby thing. \nSpeaker 1 00:07:36\nSo it's, I mean, Abby's been attending them. So in the way I'm trying to, when I heard about this role, this product architect role, I was trying to figure out a way, one, for me to understand it, and two, for everybody else, for me to tell everybody else how it works. And so what I've been kind of in my mind thinking is that if you, on a spectrum of business to technical, you've got like Abby as a business person, and then you, and then on my side,\nSpeaker 1 00:08:08\nwe're going to hire a solution architect, which is kind of like going to be right in the middle, and then the enterprise architects, and then the engineering.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:16\nAwesome. Yep.\nSpeaker 1 00:08:18\nThat makes sense. That actually helps out that spectrum helps out quite a bit. So are you actively hiring for that solution architect perspective? Is that okay? Yeah. So I've got two, I've got me and I'm still doing enterprise architect work. I'm trying to get myself out of that just because there's so much going on and I can't stay on top of what I need to do. Sure. But I've got two other enterprise architects that work for me. And then right now I've got a data, I've got the data team under me, although that may be changing. I'll keep a data architect.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:49\nProbably move the data engineers out from underneath me. Sure. Yeah, it was it was interesting talking with Abby about how, how new this role is, or this concept, you know, so it was, it seemed like a good fit. It seems like I have a lot to bring to the offering here. So it Yeah, it definitely does. I mean, it's something we've every thing we've gone into, basically, it's been.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:17\nMe or Bo, who's our CTO, or there's another guy, Ian, who he runs, like, he's the VP in charge of, like, state implementations.\nSpeaker 3 00:09:28\nYeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:29\nSo versus, like, we now have a VP over product, over, like, I'm sorry, Abby's filling that VP of product. There's, like, a VP of engineering, which is really the product engineering. And then there's Ian, who's over the VP of, you know, the implementations of our products in the states. Almost like a services.\nSpeaker 2 00:09:50\nWe refer to those as services almost for the implementations.\nSpeaker 1 00:",

Almost like a services.\nSpeaker 2 00:09:50\nWe refer to those as services almost for the implementations.\nSpeaker 1 00:09:53\nYeah, I mean, the one difference that we've tried to do compared to, like, understanding on, well, I mean, did you know Britt. \nSpeaker 2 00:10:03\nOh, yeah. I work very closely with Britt, yeah.\nSpeaker 1 00:10:06\nYeah, so, I mean, she's our new VP of engineering. Okay, great. So she and I were talking this week. She just started this. She just started this week. And. It sounded like with OnBase that it was much more customizable per state. It was super customizable. We actually are actively trying to avoid doing that. We're trying to go more the SAP model. Look, our process, not just our software, but our process is better than what you've got.\nSpeaker 1 00:10:39\nSo just use what we've got. We'll integrate with everything you have. We'll do everything that we have to do statutorily. But we don't want this thing to look that much different in New Jersey than it does in West Virginia. It should be pretty much the same product. So that's what the state implementation team's job is to do. We have what we call state plugins. Basically, that's where we abstract out whatever, like either specific logic or the way we display something that has to happen in that state.\nSpeaker 1 00:11:14\nThat's what we use. And that's really where the state implementation lives. that or at least all of this take all of this with a grain of salt because they're so busy this is very informative for me so yeah but the plan is that state implementation team basically owns the state plugins and then the engineering team owns the product so state plugin team might say oh hey we just did this for new jersey it'd be really helpful in all of the states to have this.\nSpeaker 1 00:11:46\ngo back to the engineering team they build it into the product sure then you know yeah i i like.\nSpeaker 2 00:11:53\nI really like your concept of being a little bit more opinionated with the workflow step.\nSpeaker 1 00:11:59\nYeah.\nSpeaker 2 00:11:60\nBecause, I mean, that is a downfall of, I wouldn't say downfall, but it is a complex point of the on-base schema is the fact that you can, there's a lot of checks and balances and sometimes they are failing because it is so customizable.\nSpeaker 1 00:12:16\nYeah. So, I mean, and again, there's different ways to do it. This is just the way we chose to do it. Sure.\nSpeaker 2 00:12:25\nOh, yeah. Now, how much of this V2 or Vnext is in place today. \nSpeaker 1 00:12:36\nSo, like I said, it depends which product we're talking about. The VTOS, which is our titling. registration module yeah that's the one that needs that's the one we originally wrote for west virginia and needs to get redone you're right we've created a second version of it but it's really slimmed out because one of the things we we moving towards so like elts which is our like i said the one that talks to lenders yep it it needs to know about titles so that it can remove.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:09\na lien from the title sure well we had kind of a bastardized way of doing it and we didn't like it so what we've said is well we'll put a vtas everywhere we put elts we'll put a headless, there's no ui for it okay its job basically is to manage the titles and then the other thing it does it knows whether or not we're the system of record or the state's the system of record, so like in illinois we are not the system of record right so but we're gonna have a vtas there.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:40\nthat kind of just, ELT knows how to talk to VITAS. VITAS says, oh, this is not, I don't know this. I need to go talk to the state and get it from their mainframe. Got it. Okay. To pull it back. So we've gotten that version of, which is the next version of VITAS there. What we need to do is basically build the, when we are the system of record, we need to build all that into it. Okay. Okay.

The team knows the general product structure and explores “how do we plug” the state’s systems into their product.\n- Key constraint discussion example:\n  - Unique identifier requirement for titles: “[Kevin] … we really need a unique idea how can we do this …”\n  - Some states have mutable identifiers tied to legacy processes: “[Kevin] … developer… well this is how we’ve always done it …”\n  - Outcome is to provoke and capture state-side discussions, then have architects propose technical solutions: “[Kevin] … getting those conversations going and then capturing it all and bringing it back. So that then the architects can say, okay, here’s how we can solve this technically.”\n- Tyler noted benefit of allowing stakeholders to debate internally: “[Tyler] That’s sometimes, I prefer that sometimes because then I can be a fly on the wall per se.”\nDecisions and Direction:\n- Use discovery sessions to surface legacy constraints (e.g., lack of unique IDs) and drive toward implementable solutions.\n- Capture outcomes for architects to design state-specific integrations.\nChallenges:\n- Legacy system limitations (e.g., mutable title IDs).\n- Cultural resistance to change (“this is how we’ve always done it”).\nPlanned Actions:\n- Continue facilitating stakeholder-led conversations; capture requirements and constraints; feed into architecture.\nAction Items for Topic 1:\n- Identify Unique Identifier Strategy\n  - Description: Document the state’s current title identification scheme and propose a technically feasible unique ID strategy.\n  - Responsible: Architects (under Kevin)\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Leverage discovery outputs; consider mapping legacy IDs to stable unique IDs.\n- Stakeholder Discovery Facilitation\n  - Description: Schedule and run sessions to prompt cross-stakeholder discussion; capture decisions/constraints.\n  - Responsible: Abby (business), Solution Architect (to be hired), Kevin’s team\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Maintain comprehensive notes for technical planning.\nOpen Questions for Topic 1:\n- Which states currently have mutable title identifiers and what interim mapping strategies are acceptable to them?\n- What specific artifacts are expected post-session for architects (templates, decision logs, integration maps)?\n## Topic 2: Scope of JAD/Discovery Across State vs. Dealers and Other Entities\n- Tyler asked whether sessions are state-focused or also held with dealerships/smaller entities: “[Tyler] … at the state level or … individual dealerships …”\n- Kevin stated it depends, but usually not with smaller entities initially; those may",

For Driver IDs (e.g., Louisiana), focus is almost entirely state-level, with extensive integrations:\n  - AAMVA: “[Kevin] … association of motor vehicle administrators … services you have to call … team … working on those updates.”\n  - In-state integrations: courts sending DUI records, etc.\n- For ELT (Electronic Liens and Titles), primary customers are lenders and their service providers; sessions target service providers for API integrations: “[Kevin] … sessions with them … saying here’s how you call our APIs…”\nDecisions and Direction:\n- Prioritize state-level JAD for state-centric products (Driver IDs, VTAS).\n- Conduct provider-focused sessions for ELT to support API consumption.\nChallenges:\n- Coordinating multiple external integrations (AAMVA, courts, other state systems).\n- Aligning sessions to appropriate stakeholder groups (state vs. lenders/service providers vs. dealers).\nPlanned Actions:\n- Maintain dedicated teams for AAMVA integrations and in-state integrations.\n- Conduct API onboarding sessions for ELT service providers.\nAction Items for Topic 2:\n- AAMVA Services Integration Plan\n  - Description: Maintain/update integration plans for required interstate notifications (e.g., license revocations).\n  - Responsible: AAMVA Integration Team\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Ensure compliance and timely notifications.\n- In-State Court System Integration Mapping\n  - Description: Document DUI data flows and apply to license records; ensure statutory compliance.\n  - Responsible: In-State Integration Team\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Map triggers and processing steps end-to-end.\n- ELT API Onboarding Sessions\n  - Description: Conduct technical sessions for service providers on ELT API usage.\n  - Responsible: ELT Product and Engineering Teams\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Provide API docs, sandbox access, and support contacts.\nOpen Questions for Topic 2:\n- Which service providers are next in queue for ELT API onboarding?\n- Are there specific statutory timelines for interstate notifications that affect integration SLAs?\n## Topic 3: API V2 and Unified Data Model; Product Replatforming\n- Tyler asked about API V2 robustness: “[Tyler] … the apis you guys are looking to v2 … make them more robust …”\n- Kevin emphasized it’s broader than APIs: VTAS (Vehicle Titling and Registration) initially built for West Virginia was not easily portable. A Gen 2 is underway for Rhode Island and Kentucky:\n  - “[Kevin] … Gen 2 version … deployed in … Rhode Island and Kentucky … much smaller set of features … than … West Virginia.”\n  - Plan to retrofit West Virginia with Gen 2 and expand features.\n- Unified data model referenced by Tyler and affirmed by Kevin:\n  - “[Tyler] Hence the unified data model …”\n  - “[Kevin] So.”\n- Kevin noted high workload across states and phases, and interest from New Jersey and Illinois:\n  - New Jersey: Phase 2 to include full vehicle titling, dealers submitting transfer agreements electronically.\n  - Illinois: ELT in place; pursuing dealer submissions.\nDecisions and Direction:\n- Pursue an opinionated product approach minimizing per-state customization; standardize process and product akin to SAP model.\n- Use state plugins to encapsulate state-specific logic/UI displays; engineering owns product, state implementations own plugins.\n- Feedback loop from state plugin team to engineering to generalize features.\nChallenges:\n- Retrofitting rich feature set from West Virginia into standardized Gen 2 while supporting scalability.\n- Coordinating dealer involvement and electronic submissions in states planning expansions.\n- Managing workload across multiple concurrent state projects.\nPlanned Actions:\n- Continue building Gen 2 VTAS for portability and scalability.\n- Integrate dealer submission capabilities where states request (NJ, IL).\n- Develop and iterate unified data model underpinning the products.\nAction Items for Topic 3:\n- VTAS Gen 2 Rollout Plan\n  - Description: Define scope and deployment targets for Gen 2 VTAS in Rhode Island and Kentucky; plan retrofit for West Virginia.\n  - Responsible: Engineering (Product) and State Implementation Team\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Account for feature parity gaps vs. West Virginia.\n- Unified Data Model Definition\n  - Description: Formalize unified data model supporting portability across states; align with API evolution.\n  - Responsible: Data Architect (under Kevin), Enterprise Architects\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Ensure cross-product compatibility (VTAS, ELT, IDs).\n- Dealer Electronic Submissions Enablement (NJ, IL)\n  - Description: Design and implement workflows and integrations for dealers to submit transfer agreements electronically.\n  - Responsible: State Implementation Team (NJ, IL), Engineering (Product)\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Consider UI, authentication, compliance requirements.\n- State Plugin Governance\n  - Description: Establish process for plugin feature feedback to be integrated back into core product when generally useful.\n  - Responsible: State Implementation Team, Engineering\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date",

Is that an Abby thing.”\n- Kevin explained a spectrum from business to technical:\n  - “[Kevin] … Abby as a business person … solution architect … enterprise architects … engineering.”\n  - Currently hiring for the Solution Architect role; Kevin is still doing enterprise architect work with two other enterprise architects, plus a data team under him (may change), retaining a data architect.\n- Leadership structure:\n  - Abby: VP of Product.\n  - Britt: VP of Engineering (product engineering). “[Kevin] … she just started this week.”\n  - Ian: VP in charge of state implementations (services-like).\n  - Bo: CTO, has historically attended sessions.\n- Tyler and Kevin discussed avoiding excessive customization (contrast with OnBase):\n  - “[Kevin] … actively trying to avoid … more the SAP model … integrate with everything … statutory requirements … product should be the same … state plugins …”\nDecisions and Direction:\n- Fill the Solution Architect role to bridge business and technical.\n- Maintain clear ownership boundaries: State Implementation Team owns state plugins; Engineering owns product.\nChallenges:\n- Kevin’s bandwidth covering enterprise architecture plus data oversight.\n- Scaling teams to support rapid growth and multiple simultaneous state efforts.\nPlanned Actions:\n- Proceed with hiring Solution Architect.\n- Clarify data team reporting and retain data architect under Kevin if team moves.\nAction Items for Topic 4:\n- Hire Solution Architect\n  - Description: Recruit and onboard a Solution Architect to operate between business and technical teams for discovery and design.\n  - Responsible: Kevin, HR/Recruiting\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Role participates in JAD/discovery and solution design.\n- Define Data Team Structure\n  - Description: Confirm organizational alignment for data engineers; maintain data architect under Kevin.\n  - Responsible: Kevin, Leadership (Abby, Britt)\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Communicate changes to teams; ensure continuity.\n- Session Attendance Protocol\n  - Description: Establish who attends which sessions (Abby/business, Solution Architect, enterprise architects, engineering as needed).\n  - Responsible: Abby, Kevin, Ian\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Document guidelines for different products and phases.\nOpen Questions for Topic 4:\n- What is the timeline and candidate profile for the Solution Architect hire?\n- Will data engineers move under another org, and when?\n## Topic 5: VTAS V1, Headless Gen 2, and System-of-Record Awareness\n- Tyler asked the status of V2/Vnext: “[Tyler] … how much of this V2 or Vnext is in place today.”\n- Kevin detailed:\n  - VTAS V1 was West Virginia-specific and not portable.\n  - A slimmed Gen 2 exists, used headlessly where ELT needs title info; no UI, manages titles, aware of system-of-record status.\n  - In Illinois, VTAS is not system of record; headless VTAS brokers calls to the state mainframe when needed: “[Kevin] … ELT knows how to talk to VITAS … go talk to the state and get it from their mainframe …”\n  - Full system-of-record functionality for VTAS remains to be built when the product is the authoritative source.\n- Tyler summarized: V1 in WV; V1.5 deployed alongside; V2 planned for scalable build. Kevin confirmed: “[Kevin] … that helps out a lot.”\nDecisions and Direction:\n- Continue using headless VTAS with system-of-record awareness; expand to full SOR capabilities where applicable.\n- Build scalable V2 VTAS that can operate as SOR or integrate with external SORs.\nChallenges:\n- Designing robust SOR logic and integration pathways.\n- Balancing minimal feature sets vs. necessary functionality for states.\nPlanned Actions:\n- Implement full SOR features in VTAS for states where the product is authoritative.\n- Maintain integration patterns for non-SOR states.\nAction Items for Topic 5:\n- System-of-Record Feature Design\n  - Description: Define and implement VTAS capabilities for when VTAS is SOR (create/update, auditing, lifecycle).\n  - Responsible: Engineering (VTAS), Enterprise Architects\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Include fallback and reconciliation with external systems.\n- Non-SOR Integration Enhancements\n  - Description: Strengthen VTAS integrations with state mainframes for non-SOR deployments (e.g., Illinois).\n  - Responsible: VTAS Engineering, State Integration Team\n  - Time Frame: Not specified\n  - Due Date: Not specified\n  - Notes: Ensure reliability, error handling, and performance.\nOpen Questions for Topic",

Any employee may file a\ncomplaint regarding incidents experienced personally or incidents observed in the workplace. The company\nstrives to maintain a pleasant work environment where all employees are able to effectively perform their\nwork without interference of any type and requests the assistance of all employees in this effort.\nAll managers and supervisors are responsible for doing all they can to prevent and discourage harassment,\nsexual harassment, and discrimination from occurring. If a complaint of harassment, sexual harassment or\ndiscrimination is raised, the individual to whom the complaint is made (i.e., supervisor, manager, company\nowner) should act promptly to notify the Insperity Anti-Harassment hotline number so an investigation may\npromptly proceed. The company and Insperity may discipline any managers or supervisors who fail to follow\nthis policy, which discipline may include termination.\n1-5. WORKERS' COMPENSATION\nOn-the-job injuries are covered by Champ Titles, Inc.'s Workers' Compensation Insurance Policy, which is\nprovided at no cost. If employees are injured on the job, no matter how slightly, they should report the\nincident immediately to their supervisor. Failure to follow Company procedures may affect the ability of\nemployees to receive Workers Compensation benefits.\nThis is solely a monetary benefit and not a leave of absence entitlement. Employees who need to miss work\ndue to a workplace injury must also request a formal leave of absence. See the Leave of Absence sections of\nthis handbook for more information.\nQuestions regarding workers' compensation insurance coverage should be directed to your supervisor or the\nInsperity Workers’ Compensation Department at 866-250-9661.\n12\n1-6. OPEN DOOR - ISSUE RESOLUTION\nChamp Titles has an open-door policy for all employees. This means that each manager's door is open to\nevery employee in order to encourage open communication, feedback, and discussion about any matter of\nimportance to any employee.  By listening to the employees, the Company is able to improve, address\ncomplaints, and foster understanding of the rationale for practices, processes, and decisions.\nMost problems can and should be raised first with an employee’s immediate supervisor. Employees may also\ndiscuss their issues and concerns with the next level of management and/or the Vice President of HR\n(HR@champtitles.com), or by using Insperity’sanonymous reporting hotline by calling 844-677-3030 or\nemailing eeoteam@insperity.com.\nExperience shows that most issues can be resolved by a simple examination and discussion of the facts. \nWhile we cannot guarantee an easy or preferable solution to every concern, every effort will be made to\nreach a mutually satisfactory solution as quickly as possible. By solving problems together, the Company\nbenefits by gaining valuable insight into possible problems with existing methods, procedures, and\napproaches.\n1-7.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the Company's honesty and integrity, and\ntherefore its reputation, are not compromised. The fundamental principle guiding this policy is that no\nemployee should have, or appear to have, personal interests or relationships that actually or potentially\nconflict with the best interests of the Company.\nIt is not possible to give an exhaustive list of situations that might involve violations of this policy.

INVENTIONS AND ASSIGNMENT\nFor the purposes of this Employee Handbook, the term “Inventions” means all inventions, improvements,\ndevelopments, concepts, ideas, expressions, processes, prototypes, plans, drawings, designs, models,\nformulations, specifications, methods, techniques, shop-practices, discoveries, innovations, creations,\ntechnologies, formulas, algorithms, data, computer databases, reports, laboratory notebooks, papers,\nwritings, photographs, source and object codes, software programs, other works of authorship, and know-\nhow and show-how (including all records pertaining to any of the foregoing), whether or not reduced to\nwriting and whether or not patented or patentable or registered or registrable under patent, copyright,\ntrademark or similar statute.  \nFor the purposes of this Employee Handbook, the term “Assigned Inventions” means (i) any and all Inventions\nthat arise out of or are based upon any Confidential Information (regardless of whether or not such\nInventions were made, conceived, invented, discovered, originated, authored, created, learned or reduced to\npractice by you at Champ Titles facilities or during regular business hours or utilizing Champ Titles resources)\nor (ii) except to the extent otherwise provided in the paragraphs below, any and all Inventions that are made,\nconceived, invented, discovered, originated, authored, created, learned or reduced to practice by you, either\nalone or together with others, during your employment with Champ Titles (regardless of whether or not such\nInventions were made, conceived, invented, discovered, originated, authored, created, learned or reduced to\npractice by you at Champ Titles facilities or during regular business hours or utilizing Champ Titles\nresources).  \nFor the purposes of this Employee Handbook, the term “Proprietary Rights” means: any and all rights under\nor in connection with any patents, patent applications, copyrights, copyright applications, trademarks,\ntrademark applications, service marks, service mark applications, trade names, trade name applications,\nmask works, trade secrets and/or other intellectual property rights with respect to Assigned Inventions; and\nthe goodwill associated with any and all of the rights referred to in the foregoing clause.\nUnder certain circumstances, Assigned Inventions may be considered original works of authorship\nprotectable by copyright.

That would occur where any component of the\n14\nAssigned Inventions or Proprietary Rights either does not qualify as a “work made for hire” under U.S.\ncopyright law, or is subject to protection under patent, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property\nlaw.  In such instance, Champ Titles requires that you give the Company prompt written notice of any\nAssigned Invention or Proprietary Right and expects you to execute such instruments of transfer, assignment,\nconveyance or confirmation and such other documents needed to evidence, confirm or perfect the\nassignment of all of your right, title and interest in and to any and all Assigned Inventions and Proprietary\nRights.",

This includes the voice mail, e-mail and Internet systems. Users have no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in regard to their use of the Champ Titles, Inc. systems.\nChamp Titles, Inc. may access the voice mail and e-mail systems and obtain the communications within the\nsystems, including past voice mail and e-mail messages, without notice to users of the system, in the ordinary\ncourse of business when the Company deems it appropriate to do so. The reasons for which the Company\nmay obtain such access include, but are not limited to: maintaining the system; preventing or investigating\nallegations of system abuse or misuse; assuring compliance with software copyright laws; complying with\nlegal and regulatory requests for information; and ensuring that Company operations continue appropriately\nduring the employee's absence.\nFurther, Champ Titles, Inc. may review Internet usage to ensure that such use with Company property, or\ncommunications sent via the Internet with Company property, are appropriate. The reasons for which the\nCompany may review employees' use of the Internet with Company property include, but are not limited to:\n15\nmaintaining the system; preventing or investigating allegations of system abuse or misuse; assuring\ncompliance with software copyright laws; complying with legal and regulatory requests for information; and\nensuring that Company operations continue appropriately during the employee's absence.\nThe Company may store electronic communications for a period of time after the communication is created.\nFrom time to time, copies of communications may be deleted.\nThe Company's policies prohibiting harassment, in their entirety, apply to the use of Company's\ncommunication and computer systems. No one may use any communication or computer system in a manner\nthat may be construed by others as harassing or offensive based on race, national origin, sex, sexual\norientation, age, disability, religious beliefs or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law.\nFurther, since the Company's communication and computer systems are intended for business use, all\nemployees, upon request, must inform management of any private access codes or passwords.\nChamp Titles, Inc. intends to prevent computer viruses and unauthorized use of copyrighted materials\nbelonging to entities other than the company.

PERSONAL AND COMPANY-PROVIDED PORTABLE COMMUNICATION DEVICES\nChamp Titles, Inc.-provided portable communication devices (PCDs), including cell phones and personal\ndigital assistants, should be used primarily for business purposes. Employees have no reasonable expectation\nof privacy in regard to the use of such devices, and all use is subject to monitoring, to the maximum extent\npermitted by applicable law. This includes, as permitted, the right to monitor personal communications as\nnecessary.\nSome employees may be authorized to use their own PCD for business purposes. These employees should\nwork with the IT department to configure their PCD for business use. Communications sent via a personal\nPCD also may subject to monitoring if sent through the Company's networks and the PCD must be provided\nfor inspection and review upon request.\nAll conversations, text messages and e-mails must be professional. When sending a text message or using a\nPCD for business purposes, whether it is a Company-provided or personal device, employees must comply\nwith applicable Company guidelines, including policies on sexual harassment, discrimination, conduct,\nconfidentiality, equipment use and operation of vehicles. Using a Company-issued PCD to send or receive\npersonal text messages is prohibited at all times and personal use during working hours should be limited to\nemergency situations.\nIf employees who use a personal PCD for business resign or are discharged, they will be required to submit\nthe device to the IT department for resetting on or before their last day of work. At that time, the IT\ndepartment will reset and remove all information from the device, including but not limited to, Company\ninformation and personal data (such as contacts, e-mails and photographs). The IT department will make\n16\nefforts to provide employees with the personal data in another form (e.g., on a disk) to the extent\npracticable; however, the employee may lose some or all personal data saved on the device.\nEmployees may not use their personal PCD for business unless they agree to submit the device to the IT\ndepartment on or before their last day of work for resetting and removal of Company information. This is the\nonly way currently possible to ensure that all Company information is removed from the device at the time of\ntermination. The removal of Company information is crucial to ensure compliance with the Company's\nconfidentiality and proprietary information policies and objectives.\nPlease note that whether employees use their personal PCD or a Company-issued device, the Company's\nelectronic communications policies, including but not limited to, proper use of communications and\ncomputer systems, remain in effect.\nPortable Communication Device Use While Driving\nEmployees who drive on Company business must abide by all state or local laws prohibiting or limiting PCD\n(cell phone or personal digital assistant) use while driving. Further, even if usage is permitted, employees may\nchoose to refrain from using any PCD while driving. \"Use\" includes, but is not limited to, talking or listening to\nanother person or sending an electronic or text message via the PCD.\nRegardless of the circumstances, including slow or stopped traffic, if any use is permitted while driving,\nemployees should proceed to a safe location off the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or\naccepting a call. If acceptance of a call is absolutely necessary while driving, and permitted by law, employees\nmust use a hands-free option and advise the caller that they are unable to speak at that time and will return\nthe call shortly.\nUnder no circumstances should employees feel that they need to place themselves at risk to fulfill business\nneeds.\nSince this policy does not require any employee to use a cell phone while driving, employees who are charged\nwith traffic violations resulting from the use of their PCDs while driving will be solely responsible for all\nliabilities that result from such actions.\nTexting and e-mailing while driving is prohibited in all circumstances.\n1-12. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS & INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE\nChamp Titles, Inc. is committed to complying with applicable federal, state, and local laws governing\nreasonable accommodations of individuals, including, but not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(ADA).  To that end, we will endeavor to make a reasonable accommodation to applicants and employees\nwho have requested an accommodation or for whom Champ Titles, Inc. has notice may require such an\naccommodation, without regard to any protected classifications, related to an individual's:\nDisability, meaning any physical, medical, mental, or psychological impairment, or a history or record\nof such impairment;\nSincerely held religious beliefs and practices;\nNeeds as a victim of domestic violence, sex offenses, or stalking;\nNeeds related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; and/or\nAny other reason required by applicable law, unless the accommodation would impose an undue\nhardship on the operation of our business.\n17\nAny individual who would like to request an accommodation based on any of the reasons set forth above\nshould contact your supervisor or Insperity human resource specialist. Accommodation requests can be made\nin writing using a form which can be obtained from your supervisor or Insperity human resource specialist.

In\nthe event Champ Titles, Inc. initiates an interactive dialogue with an employee, it should not be construed as\nChamp Titles, Inc.'s belief an individual requires an accommodation, but will serve as an invitation for the\nemployee to share with Champ Titles, Inc. any information the employee desires to share, or to request an\naccommodation.\nThe interactive dialogue may take place in person, by telephone, or by electronic means.  As part of the\ninteractive dialogue, Champ Titles, Inc. will communicate openly and in good faith with the employee in a\ntimely manner in order to determine whether and how Champ Titles, Inc. may be able to provide a\nreasonable accommodation. To the extent necessary and appropriate based on the request, Champ Titles,\nInc. will attempt to explore the existence and feasibility of alternative accommodations as well as alternative\npositions for the employee. Champ Titles, Inc. is not required to provide the specific accommodation sought\nby the employee, provided the alternatives are reasonable and either meet the specific needs of the\nemployee or specifically address the employee's limitations.\nAs part of the interactive dialogue, Champ Titles, Inc. reserves the right to request supporting documentation\nto the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\nChamp Titles, Inc. will endeavor to keep confidential all communications regarding requests for reasonable\naccommodations and all circumstances surrounding the employee's underlying reason for needing an\naccommodation.\nChamp Titles, Inc. will not allow any form of retaliation against employees who have requested an\naccommodation, for whom Champ Titles, Inc. has notice may require such an accommodation, or who\notherwise engage in the interactive dialogue process. \nEmployees with questions regarding this policy should contact your supervisor or Insperity human resource\nspecialist.\n18\nSection 2 - GENERAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n2-1. USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA\nChamp Titles, Inc. respects the right of any employee to maintain a blog or web page or to participate in a\nsocial networking, Twitter or similar site, including but not limited to Facebook and LinkedIn. However, to\nprotect Company interests and ensure employees focus on their job duties, employees must adhere to the\nfollowing rules:\nEmployees may not post on a blog or web page or participate on a social networking platform, such as Twitter\nor similar site, during work time or at any time with Company equipment or property.\nAll rules regarding confidential and proprietary business information apply in full to blogs, web pages and\nsocial networking platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or similar sites. Any information that cannot\nbe disclosed through a conversation, a note or an e-mail also cannot be disclosed in a blog, web page or social\nnetworking site.\nWhether the employees are posting something on their own blog, web page, social networking, Twitter or\nsimilar site or on someone else's, if the employee mentions the Company and also expresses either a political\nopinion or an opinion regarding the Company's actions that could pose an actual or potential conflict of\ninterest with the Company, the poster must include a disclaimer. The poster should specifically state that the\nopinion expressed is a personal opinion and not the Company's position. This is necessary to preserve the\nCompany's good will in the marketplace.\nAny conduct that is impermissible under the law if expressed in any other form or forum is impermissible if\nexpressed through a blog, web page, social networking, Twitter or similar site. For example, posted material\nthat is discriminatory, obscene, defamatory, libelous or violent is forbidden. Company policies apply equally\nto employee social media usage.\nChamp Titles, Inc. encourages all employees to keep in mind the speed and manner in which information\nposted on a blog, web page, and/or social networking site is received and often misunderstood by readers.\nEmployees must use their best judgment. Employees with any questions should review the guidelines above\nand/or consult with their manager. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in discipline, up to and\nincluding discharge.\n2-2. WORKPLACE CONDUCT\nChamp Titles, Inc. endeavors to maintain a positive work environment. Each employee plays a role in\nfostering this environment. Accordingly, we all must abide by certain rules of conduct, based on honesty,\ncommon sense and fair play.\nBecause everyone may not have the same idea about proper workplace conduct, it is helpful to adopt and\nenforce rules all can follow. Unacceptable conduct may subject the offender to disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding discharge, in the Company's sole discretion. The following are examples of some, but not all,\nconduct which can be considered unacceptable:\nObtaining employment on the basis of false or misleading information.1.\n19\nStealing, removing or defacing Champ Titles, Inc. property or a co-worker's property, and/or disclosure2.\nof confidential information.\nCompleting another employee's time records.3.\nViolation of safety rules and policies.4.\nViolation of Champ Titles, Inc.'s Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace Policy.5.\nFighting, threatening or disrupting the work of others or other violations of Champ Titles, Inc.'s6.\nWorkplace Violence Policy.\nFailure to follow lawful instructions of a supervisor.7.\nFailure to perform assigned job duties.8.\nViolation of the Punctual",

Before or during\napplication of any discipline, employees may be given an opportunity to relate their version of the incident or\nproblem and provide an explanation. Examples of progressive employee discipline include:\nVerbal Counseling - A conversation with an employee explaining that the employee’s conduct or poor\nperformance is unacceptable, and repeated or continued unacceptable conduct or performance will\nresult in more severe disciplinary action. A record of the notice of the verbal counseling may be made\nand retained in the employee's personnel file.\nWritten Counseling - A written document or memo that describes the unacceptable conduct or\nperformance of the employee and specifies needed changes or improvements. A copy of the written\ncounseling generally will be retained in the employee's personnel file.\nTermination - If an employee fails to follow acceptable conduct or performance standards, the\ncompany may terminate the employee’s employment.\nDepending on the specific circumstances, the company may suspend or terminate an employee without prior\ndiscipline, or without following a particular order of discipline.\nFinally, to protect and ensure the integrity of Champ Titles and the safety of its employees and clients,\nemployees must inform the Vice President of HR  (HR@champtitles.com) within 5 days of any felony\n20\nconviction or plea acknowledging responsibility for a felonious criminal act (i.e. no contest pleas).  Failure to\ndo so is a violation of Champ Titles Standards of Conduct and Ethics Code, and could result in disciplinary\naction, up to and including termination.\nThe observance of these rules will help to ensure that our workplace remains a safe and desirable place to\nwork.\n2-3. WORKPLACE VIOLENCE\nChamp Titles, Inc. is strongly committed to providing a safe workplace. The purpose of this policy is to\nminimize the risk of personal injury to employees and damage to Company and personal property.\nChamp Titles, Inc. does not expect employees to become experts in psychology or to physically subdue a\nthreatening or violent individual. Indeed, Champ Titles, Inc. specifically discourages employees from engaging\nin any physical confrontation with a violent or potentially violent individual.

For purposes of this policy, a threat includes any verbal or physical\nharassment or abuse, any attempt at intimidating or instilling fear in others, menacing gestures, flashing of\nweapons, stalking or any other hostile, aggressive, injurious or destructive action undertaken for the purpose\nof domination or intimidation. To the extent permitted by law, employees and visitors are prohibited from\ncarrying weapons onto Company premises.\nProcedures for Reporting a Threat\nAll potentially dangerous situations, including threats by co-workers, should be reported immediately to any\nmember of management with whom the employee feels comfortable.

SAFE HARBOR POLICY FOR EXEMPT EMPLOYEES\nIt is Champ Titles, Inc.’s policy and practice to accurately compensate employees and to do so in compliance\nwith all applicable state and federal laws. To ensure proper payment and that no improper deductions are\nmade, employees must review pay stubs promptly to identify and report all errors.\nThose classified as exempt salaried employees will receive a salary which is intended to compensate them for\nall hours they may work for Champ Titles, Inc. This salary will be established at the time of hire or\nclassification as an exempt employee. While it may be subject to review and modification from time to time,\nsuch as during salary review times, the salary will be a predetermined amount that will not be subject to\ndeductions for variations in the quantity or quality of the work performed.\nUnder federal and state law, salary is subject to certain deductions. For example, unless state law requires\notherwise, salary can be reduced for the following reasons:\nfull-day absences for personal reasons;\nfull-day absences for sickness or disability if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide\nplan, policy or practice of providing wage replacement benefits for such absences (deductions also\nmay be made for the exempt employee's full-day absences due to sickness or disability before the\nemployee has qualified for the plan, policy or practice or after the employee has exhausted the leave\nallowance under the plan);\nfull-day disciplinary suspensions for infractions of our written policies and procedures;\nFamily and Medical Leave Act absences (either full- or partial-day absences);\nto offset amounts received as payment from the court for jury and witness fees or from the military as\nmilitary pay;\nthe first or last week of employment in the event the employee works less than a full week; and\nany full work week in which the employee does not perform any work.\nSalary may also be reduced for certain types of deductions such as a portion of health, dental or life insurance\npremiums; state, federal or local taxes; social security; or voluntary contributions to a 401(k) or pension plan.\nIn any work week in which the employee performed any work, salary will not be reduced for any of the\nfollowing reasons:\n28\npartial day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability;\nan absence because the Company has decided to close a facility on a scheduled work day;\nabsences for jury duty, attendance as a witness, or military leave in any week in which the employee\nperformed any work (subject to any offsets as set forth above); and\nany other deductions prohibited by state or federal law.\nHowever, unless state law provides otherwise, deductions may be made to accrued leave for full- or partial-\nday absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability.\nIf employees believe they have been subject to any improper deductions, they should immediately report the\nmatter to a supervisor.

PAID TIME OFF\nChamp Titles, Inc. appreciates how hard employees work and recognizes the importance of providing time for\nrest and relaxation. Champ Titles, Inc. fully encourages employees to get this rest by taking paid time off.\nTime off under this policy includes extended time off, such as for a vacation, and incidental time due to\nsickness or to handle personal affairs.\nFull-time employees accrue paid time off as follows:\nDuring the first partial calendar year of employment and the first five (5) full calendar years of employment,\nfull-time employees accrue up to 20 days of paid time off per year. Paid time off is accrued on a pro-rata basis\nthroughout the year.\nThereafter, full-time employees accrue up to 25 days of paid time off per year. Paid time off continues to be\naccrued on a pro-rata basis throughout the year.\nThe maximum paid time off entitlement for part-time employees is pro-rated based on hours worked.\nPaid time off should be taken during the year received, unless otherwise required by law. Accrued, unused\npaid time off can be carried over to the following calendar year only if approved by your supervisor or\nInsperity human resource specialist.\nIf employees wish to use three (3) or more full days of paid time off consecutively, they must submit a\nrequest to their manager at least two (2) weeks in advance of the requested time off. Similar notice should be\nprovided for planned time off of shorter duration. Every effort will be made to grant requests, consistent with\noperating schedules. However, if too many people request the same period of time off, the Company\nreserves the right to choose who may take time off during that period. Individuals with the longest length of\nservice generally will be given preference.\nIf employees will be out of work due to illness or due any other emergency for which notice could not be\nprovided, they must call in and notify their supervisor as early as possible, but at least by the start of their\nworkday. If they call in sick for three (3) or more consecutive days, they may be required to provide their\nsupervisor with a doctor's note on the day they return to work.\nPaid time off may be used only in half-day increments.\nUp to 10 days of accrued, unused paid time off is paid out upon separation, unless otherwise required by law.\nAdvanced but unaccr",

PARENTAL LEAVE\nChamp Titles offers full-time employees the opportunity to take twelve (12) weeks of job-protected leave in\nthe event the employee gives birth to a child. \nIn addition to any short term disability benefits offered and/or granted to an employee who gives birth to a\nchild, Champ Titles will also provide six weeks of paid parental leave at a rate of one- half an employee’s\nregular rate of compensation to: 1) employees who have given birth to a child, while employed at Champ\nTitles; 2) employees whose spouse or partner has given birth to a child, while employed at Champ Titles; 3)\nemployees who have adopted a child or accepted placement of a foster child, while employed at Champ\nTitles. An employee wishing to utilize any form of parental leave must notify his or her supervisor at least 30\ndays prior to the date the requested leave would commence or provide as much notice as practicable if the\nleave is not foreseeable. Parental leave under this policy must be utilized within 12 months of a child’s birth\nor placement. \nEmployees must utilize other paid time off concurrent with the parental leave offered under this policy. \nTemporary and part-time employees are not eligible for parental leave benefits under this policy.\n5-2. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE\nThe Leave Policy\nEmployees may be entitled to a leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). This policy\nprovides employees information concerning FMLA entitlements and obligations employees may have during\nsuch leaves. If employees have any questions concerning FMLA leave, they should contact Supervisor.\nI. Eligibility\nFMLA leave is available to \"eligible employees.\" To be an \"eligible employee,\" the employee must: 1) have\nbeen employed by the Company for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive); 2) have been\nemployed by the Company for at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12-month period immediately\npreceding the commencement of the leave; and 3) be employed at a worksite where 50 or more employees\nare located within 75 miles of the worksite.\nSpecial hours of service eligibility requirements apply to airline flight crew employees.\nII. Entitlements\nAs described below, the FMLA provides eligible employees with a right to leave, health insurance benefits\nand, with some limited exceptions, job restoration.\nA. Basic FMLA Leave Entitlement\nThe FMLA provides eligible employees up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for certain family and medical\nreasons during a 12-month period. The 12-month period is determined based on a rolling 12-month period\nmeasured backward from the date the employee uses their family and medical leave. Leave may be taken for\n32\nany one, or for a combination, of the following reasons:\nTo care for the employee's child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care;\nTo care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent (but not in-law) who has a serious health\ncondition;\nFor the employee's own serious health condition (including any period of incapacity due to pregnancy,\nprenatal medical care or childbirth) that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the\nessential functions of the employee's job; and/or\nBecause of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter or\nparent is a military member on covered active duty or called to covered active duty status (or has been\nnotified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Reserves component of the Armed\nForces for deployment to a foreign country in support of contingency operation or Regular Armed\nForces for deployment to a foreign country.\nA serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves either\nan overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition\nthat either prevents employees from performing the functions of their job, or prevents the qualified family\nmember from participating in school or other daily activities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing\ntreatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three (3) consecutive calendar\ndays combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing\ntreatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may\nmeet the definition of continuing treatment.\nQualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare,\naddressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, caring for the\nparents of the military member on covered active duty and attending post-deployment reintegration\nbriefings.\nB. Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement (Injured Servicemember Leave)\nIn addition to the basic FMLA leave entitlement discussed above, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son,\ndaughter, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember is entitled to take up to 26 weeks of leave during\na single 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury",

Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement (Injured Servicemember Leave)\nIn addition to the basic FMLA leave entitlement discussed above, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son,\ndaughter, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember is entitled to take up to 26 weeks of leave during\na single 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Leave to care for a\nservicemember shall only be available during a single-12 month period and, when combined with other\nFMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks during the single 12-month period. The single 12-month\nperiod begins on the first day an eligible employee takes leave to care for the injured servicemember.\nA \"covered servicemember\" is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National\nGuard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient\nstatus or is on the temporary retired list, for a serious injury or illness. These individuals are referred to in this\npolicy as \"current members of the Armed Forces.\" Covered servicemembers also include a veteran who is\ndischarged or released from military services under condition other than dishonorable at any time during the\nfive years preceding the date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran, and\nwho is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. These individuals\nare referred to in this policy as \"covered veterans.\"\nThe FMLA definitions of a \"serious injury or illness\" for current Armed Forces members and covered veterans\nare distinct from the FMLA definition of \"serious health condition\" applicable to FMLA leave to care for a\ncovered family member.\n33\nC. Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules\nFMLA leave usually will be taken for a period of consecutive days, weeks or months. However, employees also\nare entitled to take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary due\nto a serious health condition of the employee or covered family member or the serious injury or illness of a\ncovered servicemember. Qualifying exigency leave also may be taken on an intermittent basis.\nD. No Work While on Leave\nThe taking of another job while on family/medical leave or any other authorized leave of absence is grounds\nfor immediate discharge, to the extent permitted by law.\nE. Protection of Group Health Insurance Benefits\nDuring FMLA leave, eligible employees are entitled to receive group health plan coverage on the same terms\nand conditions as if they had continued to work.\nF. Restoration of Employment and Benefits\nAt the end of FMLA leave, subject to some exceptions including situations where job restoration of \"key\nemployees\" will cause the Company substantial and grievous economic injury, employees generally have a\nright to return to the same or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits and other employment\nterms. The Company will notify employees if they qualify as \"key employees,\" if it intends to deny\nreinstatement, and of their rights in such instances. Use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any\nemployment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an eligible employee's FMLA leave.\nG. Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA Leave\nEmployees requesting FMLA leave are entitled to receive written notice from the Company telling them\nwhether they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if not eligible, the reasons why they are not eligible. When\neligible for FMLA leave, employees are entitled to receive written notice of: 1) their rights and responsibilities\nin connection with such leave; 2) Company's designation of leave as FMLA-qualifying or non-qualifying, and if\nnot FMLA-qualifying, the reasons why; and 3) the amount of leave, if known, that will be counted against the\nemployee's leave entitlement.\nThe Company may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave with appropriate written notice to employees\nprovided the Company's failure to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying at an earlier date did not cause harm or\ninjury to the employee. In all cases where leaves qualify for FMLA protection, the Company and employee can\nmutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA leave.\nIII. Employee FMLA Leave Obligations\nA. Provide Notice of the Need for Leave\nEmployees who take FMLA leave must timely notify the Company of their need for FMLA leave. The following\ndescribes the content and timing of such employee notices.\n1. Content of Employee Notice\nTo trigger FMLA leave protections, employees must inform their supervisor of the need for FMLA-qualifying\nleave and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave, if known. Employees may do this by either\nrequesting FMLA leave specifically, or explaining the reasons for leave so as to allow the Company to\ndetermine that the leave is FMLA-qualifying. For example, employees might explain that:\n34\na medical condition renders them unable to perform the functions of their job;\nthey are pregnant or have been hospitalized overnight;\nthey or a covered family member are under the continuing care of a health care provider;\nthe leave is due to a qualifying exigency caused by a military member being on covered active duty or\ncalled to covered active duty status to a foreign country; or\nif the leave is for a family member, that the condition renders the family member unable to perform\ndaily activities or that the family member is a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.",

Employees must respond to the Company's questions to determine if\nabsences are potentially FMLA-qualifying.\nIf employees fail to explain the reasons for FMLA leave, the leave may be denied. When employees seek leave\ndue to FMLA-qualifying reasons for which the Company has previously provided FMLA-protected leave, they\nmust specifically reference the qualifying reason for the leave or the need for FMLA leave.\n2. Timing of Employee Notice\nEmployees must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is\nforeseeable. When 30 days' notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of the need for leave is not\nforeseeable, employees must provide the Company notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable under\nthe facts and circumstances of the particular case. Employees who fail to give 30 days' notice for foreseeable\nleave without a reasonable excuse for the delay, or otherwise fail to satisfy FMLA notice obligations, may\nhave FMLA leave delayed or denied.\nB. Cooperate in the Scheduling of Planned Medical Treatment (Including Accepting Transfers to Alternative\nPositions) and Intermittent Leave or Reduced Leave Schedules\nWhen planning medical treatment, employees must consult with the Company and make a reasonable effort\nto schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the Company's operations, subject to the approval of the\nemployee's health care provider. Employees must consult with the Company prior to the scheduling of\ntreatment to work out a treatment schedule that best suits the needs of both the Company and the\nemployees, subject to the approval of the employee's health care provider . If employees providing notice of\nthe need to take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical treatment neglect to fulfill this\nobligation, the Company may require employees to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the\napproval of the employee's health care provider.\nWhen employees take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable planned medical\ntreatment for the employee or a family member, including during a period of recovery from a serious health\ncondition or to care for a covered servicemember, the Company may temporarily transfer employees, during\nthe period that the intermittent or reduced leave schedules are required, to alternative positions with\nequivalent pay and benefits for which the employees are qualified and which better accommodate recurring\nperiods of leave.\nWhen employees seek intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule for reasons unrelated to the planning\nof medical treatment, upon request, employees must advise the Company of the reason why such leave is\nmedically necessary. In such instances, the Company and employee shall attempt to work out a leave\nschedule that meets the employee's needs without unduly disrupting the Company's operations, subject to\nthe approval of the employee's health care provider.\nC. Submit Medical Certifications Supporting Need for FMLA Leave (Unrelated to Requests for Military\n35\nFamily Leave)\nDepending on the nature of FMLA leave sought, employees may be required to submit medical certifications\nsupporting their need for FMLA-qualifying leave. As described below, there generally are three types of FMLA\nmedical certifications: an initial certification, a recertification and a return to work/fitness for duty\ncertification.\nIt is the employee's responsibility to provide the Company with timely, complete and sufficient medical\ncertifications. Whenever the Company requests employees to provide FMLA medical certifications,\nemployees must provide the requested certifications within 15 calendar days after the Company's request,\nunless it is not practicable to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The Company will\ninform employees if submitted medical certifications are incomplete or insufficient and provide employees at\nleast seven calendar days to cure deficiencies. The Company will deny FMLA leave to employees who fail to\ntimely cure deficiencies or otherwise fail to timely submit requested medical certifications.\nWith the employee's permission, the Company (through individuals other than the employee's direct\nsupervisor) may contact the employee's health care provider to authenticate or clarify completed and\nsufficient medical certifications. If employees choose not to provide the Company with authorization allowing\nit to clarify or authenticate certifications with health care providers, the Company may deny FMLA leave if\ncertifications are unclear.\nWhenever the Company deems it appropriate to do so, it may waive its right to receive timely, complete\nand/or sufficient FMLA medical certifications.\n1. Initial Medical Certifications\nEmployees requesting leave because of their own, or a covered relation's, serious health condition, or to care\nfor a covered servicemember, must supply medical certification supporting the need for such leave from their\nhealth care provider or, if applicable, the health care provider of their covered family or service member. If\nemployees provide at least 30 days' notice of medical leave, they should submit the medical certification\nbefore leave begins. A new initial medical certification will be required on an annual basis for serious medical\nconditions lasting beyond a single leave year.\nIf the Company has reason to doubt initial medical certifications, it may require employees to obtain a second\nopinion at the Company's expense. If the opinions of the initial and second health care providers differ, the\nCompany may,",

If the opinions of the initial and second health care providers differ, the\nCompany may, at its expense, require employees to obtain a third, final and binding certification from a\nhealth care provider designated or approved jointly by the Company and the employee.\n2. Medical Recertifications\nDepending on the circumstances and duration of FMLA leave, the Company may require employees to\nprovide recertification of medical conditions giving rise to the need for leave. The Company will notify\nemployees if recertification is required and will give employees at least 15 calendar days to provide medical\nrecertification.\n3. Return to Work/Fitness for Duty Medical Certifications\nUnless notified that providing such certifications is not necessary, employees returning to work from FMLA\nleaves that were taken because of their own serious health conditions that made them unable to perform\ntheir jobs must provide the Company with medical certification confirming they are able to return to work\nand the employees' ability to perform the essential functions of the employees' position, with or without\nreasonable accommodation. The Company may delay and/or deny job restoration until employees provide\nreturn to work/fitness for duty certifications.\n36\nD. Submit Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave\nUpon request, the first time employees seek leave due to qualifying exigencies arising out of the covered\nactive duty or call to covered active duty status of a military member, the Company may require employees\nto provide: 1) a copy of the military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the\nmilitary indicating the military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status and the\ndates of the military member's covered active duty service; and 2) a certification from the employee setting\nforth information concerning the nature of the qualifying exigency for which leave is requested. Employees\nshall provide a copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military for leaves arising\nout of qualifying exigencies arising out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty status\nof the same or a different military member.\nWhen leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, the Company may\nrequire employees to obtain certifications completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered\nservicemember. In addition, and in accordance with the FMLA regulations, the Company may request that the\ncertification submitted by employees set forth additional information provided by the employee and/or the\ncovered servicemember confirming entitlement to such leave.\nE. Substitute Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA Leave\nEmployees must use any accrued paid time while taking unpaid FMLA leave.\nThe substitution of paid time for unpaid FMLA leave time does not extend the length of FMLA leave and the\npaid time will run concurrently with the employee's FMLA entitlement.\nLeaves of absence taken in connection with a disability leave plan or workers' compensation injury/illness\nshall run concurrently with any FMLA leave entitlement. Upon written request, the Company will allow\nemployees to use accrued paid time to supplement any paid disability benefits.\nF. Pay Employee's Share of Health Insurance Premiums\nDuring FMLA leave, employees are entitled to continued group health plan coverage under the same\nconditions as if they had continued to work. Unless the Company notifies employees of other arrangements,\nwhenever employees are receiving pay from the Company during FMLA leave, the Company will deduct the\nemployee portion of the group health plan premium from the employee's paycheck in the same manner as if\nthe employee was actively working.\nIf FMLA leave is unpaid, employees must pay their portion of the group health premium through a ''pay-as-\nyou-go'' method.\nThe Company's obligation to maintain health care coverage ceases if the employee's premium payment is\nmore than 30 days late. If the employee's payment is more than 15 days late, the Company will send a letter\nnotifying the employees that coverage will be dropped on a specified date unless the co-payment is received\nbefore that date. If employees do not return to work within 30 calendar days at the end of the leave period\n(unless employees cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or other circumstances\nbeyond their control), they will be required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the premiums the\nCompany paid for maintaining coverage during their unpaid FMLA leave.\nIV. Questions and/or Complaints about FMLA Leave\nIf you have questions regarding this FMLA policy, please contact Supervisor. The Company is committed to\ncomplying with the FMLA and, whenever necessary, shall interpret and apply this policy in a manner\n37\nconsistent with the FMLA.\nThe FMLA makes it unlawful for employers to: 1) interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of any right\nprovided under FMLA; or 2) discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made\nunlawful by FMLA or involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA. If employees believe their\nFMLA rights have been violated, they should contact Supervisor immediately. The Company will investigate\nany FMLA complaints and take prompt and appropriate remedial action to address and/or remedy any FMLA\nviolation. Employees also may file FMLA complaints with the United States Department of Labor or may bring\nprivate lawsuits alleging FMLA violations.\nV. Coordination of FMLA Leave with Other",

For additional information concerning leave\nentitlements and obligations that might arise when FMLA leave is either not available or exhausted, please\nconsult the Company's other leave policies in this handbook or contact Supervisor.\nFor questions regarding rights or responsibilities under this policy, please call the Insperity Contact Center toll\nfree at 866-715-3552(select “Benefits”), weekdays between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Central time.\nFor questions regarding 401(k) loan payments, contact Insperity Retirement Services at 888-401-5273.\nView the Department of Labor Notice to Employees of Rights Under FMLA document located at\nhttp://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/fmlaen.pdf. \n5-3. MILITARY LEAVE\nIf employees are called into active military service or enlist in the uniformed services, they will be eligible to\nreceive an unpaid military leave of absence. To be eligible for military leave, employees must provide\nmanagement with advance notice of service obligations unless they are prevented from providing such notice\nby military necessity or it is otherwise impossible or unreasonable to provide such notice. Provided the\nabsence does not exceed applicable statutory limitations, employees will retain reemployment rights and\naccrue seniority and benefits in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. Employees should ask\nmanagement for further information about eligibility for Military Leave.\nIf employees are required to attend yearly Reserves or National Guard duty, they can apply for an unpaid\ntemporary military leave of absence not to exceed the number of days allowed by law (including travel). They\nshould give management as much advance notice of their need for military leave as possible so that Champ\nTitles, Inc. can maintain proper coverage while employees are away.\n5-4. JURY DUTY\nChamp Titles, Inc. realizes that it is the obligation of all U.S. citizens to serve on a jury when summoned to do\nso. All employees will be allowed time off to perform such civic service as required by law. Employees are\nexpected, however, to provide proper notice of a request to perform jury duty and verification of their\nservice.\nEmployees also are expected to keep management informed of the expected length of jury duty service and\nto report to work for the major portion of the day if excused by the court. If the required absence presents a\nserious conflict for management, employees may be asked to try to postpone jury duty.\n38\nEmployees on jury duty leave will be paid for their jury duty service in accordance with state law; however,\nexempt employees will be paid their full salary for any week in which time is missed due to jury duty if work is\nperformed for the Company during such week.\n39\nSection 6 - END OF EMPLOYMENT\n6-1. IF YOU MUST LEAVE US\nShould any employees decide to leave the Company, we ask that they provide a Supervisor with at least 2\nweeks advance notice of departure. Thoughtfulness will be appreciated. All Company, property including, but\nnot limited to, keys, security cards, parking passes, laptop computers, fax machines, uniforms, etc., must be\nreturned at separation. Employees also must return all of the Company's Confidential Information upon\nseparation. To the extent permitted by law, employees will be required to repay the Company (through\npayroll deduction, if lawful) for any lost or damaged Company property. As noted previously, all employees\nare employed at-will and nothing in this handbook changes that status.\n40\nSection 7 - CALIFORNIA ADDENDUM\n7-1.

OVERTIME\nLike most successful companies, Champ Titles, Inc. experiences periods of extremely high activity. During\nthese busy periods, additional work is required from all of us. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring\nbusiness activity and requesting overtime work if it is necessary. Effort will be made to provide employees\nwith adequate advance notice in such situations.\nNon-exempt employees generally will be paid overtime at the rate of time and one-half (1.5) times their\nregular hourly wage for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in one (1) day or 40 hours in one (1)\nweek, or for the first eight (8) hours on the seventh (7th) day in the same workweek.\nNon-exempt employees generally will be paid double-time for hours worked in excess of 12 in any workday or\nin excess of eight (8) on the seventh (7th) day of the workweek.\nEmployees may work overtime only with management authorization.\nFor purposes of calculating overtime for non-exempt employees, the workweek begins at 12 a.m. on Monday\nand ends 168 hours later at 12 a.m. on the following Monday.\n7-6. SAFE HARBOR POLICY FOR EXEMPT EMPLOYEES\nIt is Company policy and practice to accurately compensate employees and to do so in compliance with all\napplicable state and federal laws. To ensure employees are paid properly and no improper deductions are\nmade, employees must review their pay stubs promptly to identify and to report all errors.\nIf the employee believes a mistake has occurred or if the employee has any questions, the employee should\nuse the reporting procedure outlined below.\nExempt salaried employees receive a salary which is intended to compensate for all hours worked for the\n46\nCompany. This salary will be established at the time of hire or when the employee becomes classified as an\nexempt employee. While it may be subject to review and modification from time-to-time, such as during\nsalary review times, the salary will be a predetermined amount that will not be subject to deductions for\nvariations in the quantity or quality of the work performed.\nUnder state law, salary is subject to certain deductions. For example, the employee's salary can be reduced\nfor the following reasons:\nfull-day absences for personal reasons;\nfull-day absences for sickness or disability, if the available paid sick leave has been exhausted;\nintermittent absences, including partial-day absences, covered by the federal Family and Medical\nLeave Act, if other available paid leave has been exhausted;\nto offset amounts received as payment for jury and witness fees or military pay;\nduring the first or last week of employment in the event the employee works less than a full week; and\nany work week in which the employee performs no work for the Company.\nSalary also may be reduced for certain types of deductions, such as the employee portion of health, dental or\nlife insurance premiums; state, federal or local taxes, social security; or, voluntary contributions to a 401(k) or\npension plan.\nIn any workweek in which the employee performed any work, the employee's salary will not be reduced for\nany of the following reasons:\npartial-day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability;\nabsence on a holiday when the facility is closed or because the facility is otherwise closed on a\nscheduled workday;\nabsences for jury duty, attendance as a witness or military leave in any week in which the employee\nhas performed any work; and\nany other deductions prohibited by state or federal law.\nIf employees believe they have been subject to any improper deductions, they should immediately report the\nmatter to their supervisor. If the supervisor is unavailable or if employees believe it would be inappropriate to\ncontact that person (or if they have not received a prompt and fully acceptable reply), they should\nimmediately contact Insperity human resource specialist or any other supervisor in the Company with whom\nthe employee feels comfortable. If employees are unsure of whom to contact if they have not received a\nsatisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting the incident, they should immediately\ncontact the Company President.\nEvery report will be fully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate, up to and\nincluding termination for any employee who violates this policy. In addition, the Company will not allow any\nform of retaliation against individuals who report alleged violations of this policy or who cooperate in the\ninvestigation of such reports. Retaliation is unacceptable, and any form of retaliation in violation of this policy\nwill result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n47\n7-7.

Eligible employees may\nreceive up to eight (8) weeks of Supplemental Compensation in a 12-month period.\nEligible Employees\nTo be eligible to receive benefits under this policy, employees must meet all of the following criteria:\nbe absent from work due to an approved leave of absence for the purpose of bonding with a new child1.\nduring the first year after birth of the child or placement of the child with the employee through foster\ncare or adoption;\nhave worked at least 180 calendar days for the Company before beginning any parental leave;2.\nperform at least eight (8) hours of work per week for the Company within the geographic boundaries3.\nof the City and County of San Francisco;\nperform at least 40% of their total weekly hours within the geographic boundaries of the City and4.\nCounty of San Francisco;\nbe receiving wage replacement benefits from the State of California’s Paid Family Leave (PFL) program5.\nfor the purpose of bonding with a new child;\nagree to allow the Company to deduct up to two (2) weeks of accrued PTO from the employee's leave6.\nbank to offset the cost of any Supplemental Compensation benefits; and\ncomply with the procedures for requesting Supplemental Compensation benefits described below.7.\nEmployees who do not meet all of the above criteria are not eligible to receive Supplemental Compensation\nunder this policy, but may still be eligible for benefits in accordance with the State of California PFL program.\nSupplemental Compensation Benefit\nThe weekly Supplemental Compensation benefit is calculated based on the employee's wages and will be\ncalculated in accordance with the San Francisco Paid Parental Leave Ordinance. Unless otherwise provided by\nlaw, the employee's weekly Supplement Compensation benefit will be equal to the difference between the\n50\nweekly benefit received by the employee from the State of California PFL program and the weekly wage\nassociated with that PFL benefit amount. Supplemental Compensation is only available during the period the\nemployee is eligible for and is receiving weekly PFL benefits for the purpose of bonding with a new child.\nEmployees can receive up to eight (8) weeks of Supplemental Compensation benefits.\nProcedure for Receiving Supplemental Compensation\nIn order to receive Supplemental Compensation, employees must comply with the following procedures:\nsend an email to your supervisor or Insperity human resource specialist stating they understand and1.\nagree that up to two (2) weeks of PTO will be deducted from their leave bank to offset the costs in\nproviding Supplemental Compensation;\nprovide the Company with a copy of the employee's Notice of Computation of California Paid Family2.\nLeave Benefits (Notice) from California’s Employment Development Department (EDD) and provide\nEDD with permission to share the employee's California PFL weekly benefit amount with the Company;\ncomplete and sign the San Francisco Paid Parental Leave Employee Form (PPL Form) (available from3.\nyour supervisor or Insperity human resource specialist).

PERSONAL LEAVE\nIf employees are ineligible for any other Company leave of absence, Champ Titles, Inc., under certain\ncircumstances, may grant a personal leave of absence without pay. A written request for a personal leave\nshould be presented to management at least two (2) weeks before the anticipated start of the leave. If the\nleave is requested for medical reasons and employees are not eligible for FMLA and CFRA, medical\n51\ncertification also must be submitted. The request will be considered on the basis of staffing requirements and\nthe reasons for the requested leave, as well as performance and attendance records. Normally, a leave of\nabsence will be granted for a period of up to eight (8) weeks. However a personal leave may be extended if,\nprior to the end of leave, employees submit a written request for an extension to management and the\nrequest is granted. During the leave, employees will not earn vacation, personal days or sick days. We will\ncontinue health insurance coverage during the leave if employees submit their share of the monthly premium\npayments to the Company in a timely manner, subject to the terms of the plan documents.\nWhen the employees anticipate returning to work, they should notify management of the expected return\ndate. This notification should be made at least one week before the end of the leave.\nUpon completion of the personal leave of absence, the Company will attempt to return employees to their\noriginal job or a similar position, subject to prevailing business considerations. Reinstatement, however, is not\nguaranteed.\nFailure to advise management of availability to return to work, failure to return to work when notified or a\ncontinued absence from work beyond the time approved by the Company will be considered a voluntary\nresignation of employment.\nPersonal leave runs concurrently with any Company-provided Short-Term Disability Leave of Absence.\n7-14. TIME OFF FOR MILITARY SPOUSES\nIf the employee works, on average, at least 20 hours per week and their spouse is a qualified member of the\nUnited States Armed Forces, the National Guard or the Reserves, the employee is eligible to take leave for a\nperiod of up to 10 days while their spouse is home during a qualified leave period. When the employee is also\neligible for military family member exigency leave, leave under this policy shall also count toward the\nemployee's leave entitlement under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), where the time off meets the\ndefinition of FMLA military exigency leave.\nRequired Notice to Employer\nWithin two (2) business days of receiving official notice that the employee’s spouse will be on leave the\nemployee must provide notice to the Company of their intent to take military spouse leave.\nRequired Documentation\nThe employee must submit written documentation to the Company certifying that during the requested time\noff, the employee’s spouse will be on leave from deployment during a period of military conflict.\nLeave is Unpaid\nLeave granted under this policy is unpaid. However, employees may substitute the following for any period of\nunpaid military spouse leave: unused vacation time.\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:\n\"Qualified Member\" means any of the following:\na member of the United States Armed Forces who is deployed during a period of military conflict to an\narea designated as a combat theater or combat zone by the President of the United States; or\n52\na member of the National Guard who is deployed during a period of military conflict; or\na member of the Reserves who is deployed during a period of military conflict.\n\"Period of Military Conflict\" means any of the following:\na period of war declared by the U.S. Congress; or\na period of deployment for which members of the Reserves are ordered to active duty.\n\"Qualified Leave Period\" means the period during which the qualified member is on leave from deployment\nduring a period of military conflict.\n7-15.

Employees\nmust provide a certification from their physician regarding the purpose and length of each leave requested.\nThe employee must use any accrued vacation time, sick leave or paid time off for this leave, but the use of\nvacation accrual, sick leave or paid time off does not extend the term of this leave.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE\nEmployees may be entitled to a leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the\nCalifornia Family Rights Act (CFRA). Additionally, employees who are CFRA-eligible have certain rights to take\nboth a pregnancy disability leave (PDL) and CFRA leave for the birth of a child.\nThis policy provides employees with information concerning FMLA/CFRA entitlements and obligations they\nmay have during such leaves and also explains differences between FMLA, CFRA and PDL. Where more than\none of the laws applies, leave taken may be counted under more than one law at the same time to the extent\npermitted by the applicable law(s). For example, where leave for a pregnancy disability is also FMLA-\nqualifying, the leave will count against both FMLA and PDL entitlements. However, PDL is separate from and\ndoes not count against employees' CFRA leave entitlement. (Please consult the Pregnancy Disability Leave\npolicy for more information on PDL.) This policy will be interpreted to comply with the law(s) that apply to a\nparticular leave.\nIf employees have any questions concerning FMLA/CFRA leave, they should contact Supervisor.\nI. Eligibility\nThe FMLA and CFRA provide eligible employees with a right to leave, health insurance benefits and, with\nsome limited exceptions, job restoration. To be an \"eligible employee,\" the employee must: 1) have been\nemployed by the Company for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive) and 2) have worked for at\nleast 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave. All\nCalifornia employees who meet these two criteria are eligible for CFRA leave. California employees also may\nbe eligible to take leave for FMLA reasons if they are eligible for CFRA leave and work at a worksite where 50\nor more employees are located within 75 miles.\n*Special hours of service eligibility requirements apply to airline flight crew employees.\nII. Entitlements for FMLA/CFRA Leave\nA. Basic FMLA/CFRA Leave Entitlement\nThe FMLA/CFRA provides eligible employees up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for certain family and\nmedical reasons during a 12-month period. The 12-month period is determined by a rolling 12-month period\nmeasured backward from the date the employee uses their family and medical leave. In some instances,\nleave may be counted under the FMLA but not CFRA or CFRA but not the FMLA. Leave may be taken for any\none, or for a combination, of the following reasons:\n1. disability due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition (counts only toward FMLA leave and\nCalifornia Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL) leave entitlements);\n2. bonding and/or caring for a newborn child (counts toward FMLA and CFRA leave entitlements);\n3. for placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed\nchild (counts toward FMLA and CFRA leave entitlements);\n4. to care for the employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition; (counts toward FMLA\nand CFRA leave entitlements);\n5. to care for the employee's registered domestic partner, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild or sibling\nwith a serious health condition (counts towards CFRA entitlements only, except when grandparent,\n54\ngrandchild or sibling meets FMLA definition of",

The CFRA defines \"inpatient care\" broadly and includes a stay in a hospital, hospice or\nresidential health care facility, any subsequent treatment in connection with inpatient care or any period of\nincapacity. A person will be considered an \"inpatient\" when they are formally admitted to a health care\nfacility with the expectation that they will remain at least overnight and occupy a bed, even if the person is\nultimately discharged or transferred to another facility and does not actually remain overnight. The CFRA\ndefines \"incapacity\" as the inability to work, attend school or perform other regular daily activities due to a\nserious health condition, its treatment or the recovery that it requires.\nUnder the FMLA and CFRA, subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met\nby a period of incapacity of more than three (3) consecutive calendar days combined with at least two (2)\nvisits to a health care provider or one (1) visit and a regimen of continuing treatment or incapacity due to\npregnancy (FMLA only) or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of\ncontinuing treatment.\nQualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare,\naddressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, caring for the\nparents of the military member on covered active duty and attending post-deployment reintegration\nbriefings.\nA leave of absence in connection with a workers' compensation injury/illness or for which the employee\nreceives disability or State of California Paid Family Leave benefits shall run concurrently with FMLA/CFRA\nleave.\nB. Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement (FMLA Only)\nIn addition to the basic FMLA/CFRA leave entitlement described above, an eligible employee who is the\nspouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember is entitled to take up to 26 weeks of\n55\nleave during a 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Leave to care\nfor a servicemember is available during a single-12 month period and, when combined with other FMLA-\nqualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks during the single 12-month period. The single 12-month period\nbegins on the first day an eligible employee takes leave to care for the injured servicemember.\nA \"covered servicemember\" is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National\nGuard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient\nstatus, or is on the temporary retired list, for a serious injury or illness. These individuals are referred to in\nthis policy as \"current members of the Armed Forces.\" Covered servicemembers also include a veteran who is\ndischarged or released from military service under conditions other than dishonorable at any time during the\nfive-(5-) year period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered\nveteran, and who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness.\nThese individuals are referred to in this policy as \"covered veterans.\"\nThe FMLA definition of a serious illness or injury for current Armed Forces members and covered Veterans\nare distinct from the definition of \"serious health condition\" applicable to leave to care for a family member\nor the employee's own illness or injury.\nC.

Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules\nFMLA/CFRA leave usually will be taken for a period of consecutive days, weeks or months. However,\nemployees also are entitled to take FMLA/CFRA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when\nmedically necessary due to a serious health condition of the employee or covered family member or the\nserious injury or illness of a covered servicemember (FMLA only). Intermittent or reduced work schedule\nleave may be taken for absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated or unable to\nperform the essential functions of the position because of a chronic serious health condition, even if they do\nnot receive treatment by a health care provider. Intermittent leave can also be taken for any qualifying\nexigency.\nEmployees also are eligible for intermittent leave for bonding with a child following birth or placement.\nIntermittent leave for bonding purposes generally must be taken in two-week increments, but the Company\npermits two (2) occasions where the leave may be for less than two (2) weeks.\nD. Health Insurance Benefits Schedules\nDuring FMLA/CFRA leave, eligible employees are entitled to receive group health plan coverage on the same\nterms and conditions as if they had continued work.\nE. No Work While on Leave\nThe taking of another job while on FMLA/CFRA leave or any other approved leave of absence is prohibited\nexcept as authorized by the Company or permitted by applicable law.\nF. Restoration of Employment and Benefits\nAt the end of FMLA/CFRA leave, employees generally have a right to return to the same or equivalent\npositions they held before the FMLA/CFRA leave. There is an exception for certain \"key employees\" under the\nFMLA that applies to leave for a seriously ill or injured covered servicemember (the CFRA does not have an\nexception for \"key employees\"). The Company will provide notice if employees qualify as \"key employees\" if it\nintends to deny reinstatement and any applicable rights in such instances.\nUse of FMLA/CFRA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start\nof an eligible employee's FMLA/CFRA leave.\n56\nG. Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA/CFRA Leave\nEmployees requesting FMLA/CFRA leave are entitled to receive written notice from the Company telling them\nwhether they are eligible for FMLA/CFRA leave and, if not eligible, the reasons why they are not eligible.\nWhen eligible for FMLA/CFRA leave, employees are entitled to receive written notice of: 1) their rights and\nresponsibilities in connection with such leave; 2) the Company's designation of leave as FMLA/CFRA-\nqualifying or non-qualifying, if not FMLA/CFRA-qualifying, the reasons why; and 3) the amount of leave, if\nknown, that will be counted against the employee's leave entitlement.\nThe Company will respond to a leave request within five (5) business days. Once given, approval shall be\ndeemed retroactive to the date of the first day of the leave. The Company may designate FMLA/CFRA leave\nretroactively with appropriate notice provided that doing so does not cause harm or injury to employees. In\nother cases, the Company and employees can mutually agree that leave is retroactively designated as\nFMLA/CFRA leave.\nH. Employee Obligations for FMLA/CFRA Leaves\na. Provide Notice of the Need for Leave\nEmployees who take FMLA/CFRA leave must notify, in a timely manner, the Company of their need for\nFMLA/CFRA leave. The following describes the content and timing of such notices.\ni. Content of Notice\nTo trigger FMLA/CFRA leave protections, employees must inform their supervisor of the need for FMLA/CFRA-\nqualifying leave and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave, if known. Employees may do this by\neither requesting FMLA/CFRA leave specifically or explaining the reasons for leave so as to allow the\nCompany to determine that the leave is FMLA/CFRA-qualifying. For example, employees might explain that:\n1. a medical condition renders them unable to perform the functions of their job;\n2. they are pregnant;\n3. they or a covered family member have been hospitalized overnight;\n4. they or a covered family member are under the continuing care of a health care provider;\n5. the leave is due to a qualifying exigency caused by a military member being on covered active duty or\ncalled to covered active duty status; or\n6. if the leave is for a family member, that the condition renders the family member unable to perform daily\nactivities or that the family member is a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.\nCalling in \"sick,\" without providing the reasons for the needed leave, will not be considered sufficient notice\nfor FMLA/CFRA leave under this policy. Employees must respond to the Company's lawful questions to\ndetermine if absences are potentially FMLA/CFRA-qualifying.\nIf employees fail to explain the reasons for FMLA/CFRA leave",

Employees must respond to the Company's lawful questions to\ndetermine if absences are potentially FMLA/CFRA-qualifying.\nIf employees fail to explain the reasons for FMLA/CFRA leave, the leave may be denied. When employees\nseek leave due to FMLA/CFRA-qualifying reasons for which the Company has previously provided\nFMLA/CFRA-protected leave, they must specifically reference the qualifying reason for the leave or the need\nfor FMLA/CFRA leave.\nii. Timing of Notice\nEmployees must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA/CFRA leave when the need is\n57\nforeseeable. When 30 days' notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of the need for leave is not\nforeseeable, employees must notify the Company of the need for leave as soon as practicable under the\ncircumstances. Employees who fail to give 30 days' notice for foreseeable leave without a reasonable excuse\nfor the delay, or otherwise fail to satisfy FMLA/CFRA notice obligations, may have FMLA/CFRA leave delayed\nor denied.\nb. Cooperating in the Scheduling of Leave\nWhen planning medical treatment for themselves or family members or requesting to take leave on an\nintermittent or reduced schedule work basis, employees must consult with the Company and make a\nreasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt Company operations. Employees must\nconsult with the Company prior to scheduling treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule that best\nsuits the needs of both the Company and the employees, subject to the approval of the applicable health care\nprovider. To the extent permitted by applicable law, when employees take intermittent or reduced work\nschedule leave for foreseeable planned medical treatment for employees or family members, including a\nperiod of recovery from a serious health condition or to care for a covered servicemember, the Company may\ntemporarily transfer employees to alternative positions with equivalent pay and benefits for which the\nemployees are qualified and which better accommodate recurring periods of leave.\nc. Submit Initial Medical Certifications Supporting Need for Leave (Unrelated to Requests for Military\nFamily Leave)\nDepending on the nature of FMLA/CFRA leave sought, employees may be required to submit medical\ncertifications supporting their need for FMLA/CFRA-qualifying leave. As described below, there generally are\nthree types of FMLA/CFRA medical certifications: an initial certification, a recertification, and a return to\nwork/fitness for duty certification.\nIt is the responsibility of employees to provide the Company with timely, complete and sufficient medical\ncertifications. Whenever the Company requests employees to provide FMLA/CFRA medical certifications, they\nmust provide the requested certifications within 15 calendar days after the request, unless it is not\npracticable to do so despite diligent, good faith efforts. The Company will inform employees if submitted\nmedical certifications are incomplete or insufficient and provide them at least seven (7) calendar days to\naddress deficiencies. The Company will delay or deny FMLA/CFRA leave to employees who fail to address\ndeficiencies or otherwise fail to submit requested medical certifications in a timely manner.\nThe Company (through individuals other than the employee's direct supervisor) may contact the employee's\nhealth care provider to authenticate a medical certification.\nWhenever the Company deems it appropriate to do so, it may waive its right to receive timely, complete\nand/or sufficient FMLA/CFRA medical certifications.\ni. Initial Medical Certifications\nEmployees requesting leave because of their own or a covered family member's serious health condition, or\nto care for a covered servicemember, must supply medical certification supporting the need for such leave\nfrom their health care provider or, if applicable, the health care provider of their covered family or service\nmember. If employees provide at least 30 days' notice of medical leave, they should submit the medical\ncertification before leave begins.\nIf the Company has reason to doubt the validity of an initial medical certification regarding the employee's\nown serious health condition, it may require the employee to obtain a second opinion at the Company's\nexpense. If the opinions of the initial and second health care providers differ, the Company may, at its\n58\nexpense, require the employee to obtain a third, final and binding certification from a health care provider\ndesignated or approved jointly by the Company and the employee. The Company will reimburse employees\nfor any reasonable \"out of pocket\" travel expenses incurred to obtain second or third medical opinions.\nii. Medical Recertifications\nDepending on the circumstances and duration of FMLA/CFRA leave, the Company may require employees to\nprovide recertification of medical conditions giving rise to the need for leave. The Company will notify\nemployees if recertification is required and will give employees at least 15 calendar days to provide medical\nrecertification. In cases of leave that qualifies under CFRA, recertification will be requested only when the\noriginal certification has expired and additional leave is requested.\niii. Return to Work Release\nUnless notified that providing such certifications is not necessary, employees returning to work from\nFMLA/CFRA leaves that were taken because of their own serious health conditions must provide the\nCompany with a release to return to work from their healthcare provider stating they are able to resume\nwork. Employees taking intermittent leave may be required to provide a return to work release for such\nabsences up to once every 30 days if reasonable safety",

Employees taking intermittent leave may be required to provide a return to work release for such\nabsences up to once every 30 days if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding their ability to perform their\nduties. The Company may delay and/or deny job restoration until employees provide return to work releases.\nd. Submit Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave\nUpon request, the first time employees seek leave due to qualifying exigencies arising out of the covered\nactive duty or call to covered active duty status of a military member, the Company may require them to\nprovide: 1) a copy of the military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military\nindicating the military member is on covered active duty or call to active duty status and the dates of the\nmilitary member's covered active duty service and, 2) a certification from the employee setting forth\ninformation concerning the nature of the qualifying exigency for which leave is requested. Employees shall\nprovide a copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military for leaves arising out\nof qualifying exigencies arising out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of\nthe same or a different military member.\nWhen leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness as allowed by the\nFMLA only, the Company may require employees to obtain certifications completed by an authorized health\ncare provider of the covered servicemember. In addition, and in accordance with the FMLA regulations, the\nCompany may request that the certification submitted set forth additional information provided by the\nemployee and/or the covered servicemember confirming entitlement to such leave.\ne. Reporting Changes to Anticipated Return Date\nIf the anticipated return to work date changes and it becomes necessary for the employee to take more or\nless leave than originally anticipated, the employee must provide the Company with reasonable notice (i.e.,\nwithin two (2) business days) of their changed circumstances and new return to work date. If employees give\nthe Company unequivocal notice of their intent not to return to work, they will be considered to have\nvoluntarily resigned and the Company's obligation to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA\nrequirements) and to restore their positions will cease.\nf. Substitute Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA Leave\nEmployees are required to substitute accrued paid time while taking an unpaid FMLA/CFRA leave as follows:\nif the employee requests FMLA/PDL leave because of disability due to pregnancy, childbirth or related\n59\nmedical conditions (excluding absences for which they are receiving short-term disability benefits),\nthey must first substitute any accrued paid sick leave for unpaid family/medical leave. Employees may\nmake a written request to substitute accrued, unused vacation or other paid time off benefits for\nunpaid FMLA/PDL leave once their sick time is exhausted.\nif the employee requests FMLA/CFRA leave because of their own serious health condition (excluding\nabsences for which they are receiving workers' compensation or short-term disability benefits), they\nmust first substitute any accrued paid vacation, sick or other paid time off for unpaid family/medical\nleave.\nif the employee requests FMLA/CFRA leave to care for a covered family member with a serious health\ncondition (excluding absences for which they are receiving Paid Family Leave benefits), they must first\nsubstitute any accrued paid vacation or other paid time off for unpaid family/medical leave. Once\nvacation or other paid time off is exhausted, upon their request, they can substitute paid sick leave for\nunpaid FMLA/CFRA leave to care for a covered family member with a serious health condition.\nif the employee requests FMLA/CFRA leave to bond with a newborn or newly placed child (excluding\nabsences for which they are receiving Paid Family Leave benefits), they must first substitute any\naccrued paid vacation or other paid time off for unpaid leave.\nFor purposes of this substitution requirement, leave is not \"unpaid\" during any time for which the employee\nis receiving compensation from the State of California under its State Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave\nprograms or when receiving compensation from worker's compensation. Employees will not be required to\nuse accrued paid leave hours during any time off under this policy for which they are receiving compensation\nunder these programs. However, where applicable and permitted by law, they will be required to use paid\nleave accruals during any waiting periods applicable to these programs, and upon written request, the\nCompany will allow them to use accrued paid time off to supplement any paid workers' compensation,\ndisability or Paid Family Leave benefits.\nThe substitution of paid time off for unpaid family/medical leave time does not extend the length of\nFMLA/CFRA leaves and the paid time off runs concurrently with the FMLA/CFRA entitlement.\ng. Pay Employee's Share of Health Insurance Premiums\nAs noted above, during FMLA/CFRA leave, employees are entitled to continued group health plan coverage\nunder the same conditions as if they had continued to work. If paid leave is substituted for unpaid\nfamily/medical leave, the Company will deduct employees' shares of the health plan premium as a regular\npayroll deduction. If FMLA/CFRA leave is unpaid, employees must pay their portion of the premium through a\n''pay-as-you-go'' method. The Company's obligation to maintain health care coverage ceases if the premium\npayment is more than 30 days",

Coordination of FMLA Leave with Other Leave Policies\nThe FMLA and CFRA do not affect any federal, state or local law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any\nState or local law which provides greater family or medical leave rights. For additional information concerning\nleave entitlements and obligations that might arise when FMLA/CFRA leave is either not available or\n60\nexhausted, please consult the Company's other leave policies in this handbook or contact Supervisor.\nQUESTIONS AND/OR COMPLAINTS ABOUT FMLA/CFRA LEAVE\nIf employees have questions regarding this policy, they should contact Supervisor. The Company is committed\nto complying with the FMLA and CFRA and, whenever necessary, shall interpret and apply this policy in a\nmanner consistent with the FMLA and CFRA.\nThe FMLA makes it unlawful for employers to: 1) interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of any right\nprovided under FMLA; or 2) discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made\nunlawful by FMLA or involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA. If employees believe their\nFMLA rights have been violated, they should contact Supervisor immediately. The Company will investigate\nany FMLA complaints and take prompt and appropriate remedial action to address and/or remedy any FMLA\nviolation. Employees also may file FMLA complaints with the United States Department of Labor or may bring\nprivate lawsuits alleging FMLA violations.\n7-18. LEAVE FOR QUALIFYING ACTS OF VIOLENCE\nEmployees who are victims of a crime or abuse, including domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, may\ntake unpaid leave for up to 12 weeks for the following reasons:\nto seek medical attention for injuries caused by crime or abuse;\nto obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, rape crisis center or victim services\norganization or agency as a result of the crime or abuse;\nto obtain psychological counseling or mental health services related to an experience of crime or\nabuse; or\nto participate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future crime or abuse,\nincluding temporary or permanent relocation.\nEmployees are covered as victims and entitled to leave under this policy if they are:\na victim of stalking, domestic violence or sexual assault;\na victim of a crime that caused physical injury or that caused mental injury and a threat of physical\ninjury; or\na person whose immediate family member is deceased as the direct result of a crime.\nChamp Titles, Inc. may require proof of the employee’s participation in these activities. Whenever possible,\nemployees must provide their supervisor reasonable notice before taking any time off under this policy.\nEmployees may substitute any accrued vacation, sick or other time off for the leave under this policy. Leave\nunder this policy does not extend the time allowable under the \"Family and Medical Leave\" policy in this\nhandbook.\nNo employees will be subject to discrimination or retaliation because of their status as a victim of a crime or\nabuse, including crime or abuse related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking. Victims of a crime or\nabuse, including crime or abuse related to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, may request other\naccommodations in the workplace such as implementation of safety measures.\n61\n7-19.

For the purposes of this policy a family member includes a spouse or a\nchild, parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, domestic partner, or parent-in-law.\nBereavement leave need not be consecutive but must be completed within three (3) months of the family\nmember's death.\nBereavement leave will be paid at the employee's base rate of pay at the time of absence for the number of\nhours the employee otherwise would have worked that day. Bereavement leave is not counted as hours\nworked for purposes of calculating overtime.\nEmployees, if requested by the Company, within 30 days of the first day’s leave must provide documentation\nof the death of the family member. Documentation includes, but is not limited to, a death certificate, a\npublished obituary, or written verification of death, burial, or memorial services from a mortuary, funeral\nhome, burial society, crematorium, religious institution, or governmental agency.\nThe Company will maintain the confidentiality of any employee requesting leave under this policy including\ndocumentation provided to the Company related to a request for leave.

REPRODUCTIVE LOSS LEAVE\nEmployees who have been employed for at least 30 days will be provided with up to five (5) days of\nreproductive loss leave following a reproductive loss event. Employees who experience more than one (1)\nreproductive loss event within a 12-month period are limited to 20 days of reproductive loss leave in a 12-\nmonth period. For purposes of this policy, a reproductive loss event means the day or, for a multiple-day\nevent, the final day of a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted\nreproduction via artificial insemination or an embryo transfer.\nLeave may only be taken on regularly scheduled workdays.

TIME OFF FOR CRIME VICTIMS\nEmployees who have been victims of serious or violent felonies, as specified under California law, or felonies\nrelating to theft or embezzlement, may take time off work to attend judicial proceedings related to the crime.\nEmployees also may take time off if an immediate family member has been a victim of such crimes and the\nemployee needs to attend judicial proceedings related to the crime. \"Immediate family member\" is defined\nas spouse, registered domestic partner, child, child of registered domestic partner, stepchild, brother,\nstepbrother, sister, stepsister, mother, stepmother, father or stepfather.\nEmployees must give their supervisor a copy of the court notice given to the victim of each scheduled\nproceeding before taking time off, unless advance notice to Champ Titles, Inc. of the need for time off is not\nfeasible. When advance notice is not feasible, the employee must provide the Company with documentation\nevidencing the judicial proceeding, within a reasonable time after the absence. The documentation may be\nfrom the court or government agency setting the hearing, the district attorney or prosecuting attorney's\noffice or the victim/witness office that is advocating on behalf of the victim.\nEmployees may elect to use accrued paid vacation time, paid sick leave time or other paid time off for the\nabsence. If the employee does not elect to use paid time off, the absence will be unpaid. However, exempt\nemployees will be paid their full salary for any workweek interrupted by the need for time off under this\npolicy.\n7-22. PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE\nIf employees are disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, they are eligible to take a\npregnancy disability leave (PDL). If affected by pregnancy or a related medical condition, employees also are\neligible to transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or to less strenuous or hazardous duties, if such a\ntransfer is medically advisable and can be reasonably accommodated. Employees disabled by qualifying\nconditions may also be entitled to other reasonable accommodations where doing so is medically necessary.\nIn addition, if it is medically advisable for employees to take intermittent leave or work a reduced schedule,\nthe Company may require them to transfer temporarily to an alternative position with equivalent pay and\nbenefits that can better accommodate recurring periods of leave.\nThe PDL is for any period(s) of actual disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition\nup to four (4) months per pregnancy. For purposes of this policy, \"four months\" means time off for the\nnumber of days the employee would normally work within the four (4) calendar months (one-third of a year\nor 17 1/3 weeks), following the commencement date of taking a pregnancy disability leave. For a full-time\nemployee who works 40 hours per week, \"four months\" means 693 hours of leave entitlement, based on 40\nhours per week times 17 1/3 weeks. Employees working a part-time schedule will have their PDL calculated\non a pro-rata basis.\nThe PDL does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time, but can be taken on an intermittent",

Employees working a part-time schedule will have their PDL calculated\non a pro-rata basis.\nThe PDL does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time, but can be taken on an intermittent\nbasis pursuant to the law.\nTime off needed for prenatal or postnatal care, severe morning sickness, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-\ninduced hypertension, preeclampsia, doctor-ordered bed rest, postpartum depression, loss or end of\npregnancy, and recovery from childbirth or loss or end of pregnancy are all covered by PDL.\n63\nTo receive reasonable accommodation, obtain a transfer or take a PDL, employees must provide sufficient\nnotice so the Company can make appropriate plans. Thirty days' advance notice is required if the need for the\nreasonable accommodation, transfer or PDL is foreseeable, otherwise as soon as practicable if the need is an\nemergency or unforeseeable.\nEmployees are required to obtain a certification from their health care provider of the need for pregnancy\ndisability leave or the medical advisability of an accommodation or for a transfer. The certification is sufficient\nif it contains: (1) a description of the requested reasonable accommodation or transfer; (2) a statement\ndescribing the medical advisability of the reasonable accommodation or transfer because of pregnancy; and\n(3) the date on which the need for reasonable accommodation or transfer became or will become medically\nadvisable and the estimated duration of the reasonable accommodation or transfer.\nA medical certification indicating disability necessitating a leave is sufficient if it contains: (1) a statement that\nthe employee needs to take pregnancy disability leave because of disability due to pregnancy, childbirth or a\nrelated medical condition; (2) the date on which the employee became disabled because of pregnancy; and\n(3) the estimated duration of the leave.\nUpon request, the employee will be provided with a medical certification form that the employee can take to\nthe doctor.\nAs a condition of returning from pregnancy disability leave or transfer, the Company requires the employee\nto obtain a release from a health care provider stating ability to resume the original job duties with or without\nreasonable accommodation.\nPDL is unpaid. At the employee's option, the employee can use any accrued vacation time or other accrued\npaid time off as part of the PDL before taking the remainder of leave on an unpaid basis. Champ Titles, Inc.\nrequires, however, that the employee use any available sick time during the PDL. The substitution of any paid\nleave will not extend the duration of the PDL. Employees who participate in the Company's group health\ninsurance plan will continue to participate in the plan while on PDL under the same terms and conditions as if\nthey were working. Benefit continuation under PDL is distinct from benefit continuation for employees who\nalso take birth bonding leave under the California Family Rights Act. Employees should make arrangements\nfor payment of their share of the insurance premiums.\nChamp Titles, Inc. encourages employees to contact the California Employment Development Department\nregarding eligibility for state disability insurance for the unpaid portion of the leave.\nIf employees do not return to work on the originally scheduled return date, nor request in advance an\nextension of the agreed upon leave with appropriate medical documentation, they may be deemed to have\nvoluntarily terminated their employment with the Company. Failure to notify the Company of their ability to\nreturn to work when it occurs or continued absence from work because the leave must extend beyond the\nmaximum time allowed, may be deemed a voluntary termination of employment with the Company, unless\nemployees are entitled to Family and Medical Leave or entitled to further leave pursuant to applicable law.\nUpon return from a covered PDL, the employee, in most instances, will be reinstated to the same position.\nTaking a PDL may affect some benefits and the employee's seniority date. The employee may request more\ninformation regarding eligibility for PDL and the impact of the leave on seniority and benefits.\nAny request for leave after the disability has ended will be treated as a request for family care leave under\nthe California Family Rights Act (CFRA) and the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), if the employee\nis eligible for that type of leave. PDL runs concurrently with FMLA (but not CFRA). Employees should refer to\nthe FMLA policy. Employees who are not eligible for leave under the CFRA or FMLA will have a request for\n64\nadditional leave treated as a request for disability accommodation.\n7-23. TIME OFF FOR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS, RESERVE PEACE OFFICERS, AND EMERGENCY RESCUE\nPERSONNEL\nEmployees who are volunteer firefighters, reserve peace officers or emergency rescue personnel are\npermitted unpaid time off, not to exceed 14 days per calendar year, for the purpose of engaging in fire, law\nenforcement or emergency rescue training. If the employees request time off under the policy they must\nnotify their direct supervisor immediately after the need for the leave becomes known.\n7-24. CIVIL AIR PATROL LEAVE - CA\nChamp Titles, Inc. provides up to 10 days per calendar year of unpaid leave time to eligible employees to\nserve as a member of the Civil Air Patrol on the request of the state or its political subdivisions. To be eligible,\nyou must have completed 90 days of employment. You may choose to take accrued paid time off for the\nleave.

DISCRIMINATION AND NON-HARASSMENT (INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT)\nIn compliance with the Illinois Human Rights Act (Act) and any other related federal or local law/ordinance, all\nemployees have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination or harassment (including sexual\nharassment). This means that employers may not treat people differently based on race, age, gender,\npregnancy, disability, sexual orientation or any other protected class named in the Act or any other related\nfederal or local law/ordinance. This applies to all employer actions, including hiring, promotion, discipline and\ndischarge.\nIt is Champ Titles, Inc.'s policy to prohibit intentional and unintentional discrimination or harassment\n(including sexual harassment) of or against job applicants, contractors, interns, volunteers or employees by\nanother employee, supervisor, vendor, customer or any third party on the basis of actual or perceived race,\ncolor, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex or gender (including pregnancy,\nchildbirth and pregnancy-related conditions), gender identity or expression (including transgender status),\nsexual orientation, marital status, military service and veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic\ninformation or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws (referred to as\n\"protected characteristics\"). The Company also prohibits retaliation. All such conduct will not be tolerated by\nChamp Titles, Inc.\nThe purpose of this policy is not to regulate our employees' personal morality, but to ensure that no one\nengages in discrimination or harassment (including sexual harassment) of another individual in the workplace,\nincluding while on Company premises, while on Company business (whether or not on Company premises) or\nwhile representing the Company. In addition to being a violation of this policy, discrimination, harassment or\nretaliation based on any protected characteristic as defined by applicable federal, state or local laws also is\nunlawful. For example, sexual harassment and retaliation against an individual because the individual\nreported or filed a complaint of discrimination or harassment (including sexual harassment) or because an\nindividual aided, assisted or testified in an investigation or proceeding involving a complaint of discrimination\nor harassment (including sexual harassment) as defined by applicable federal, state or local laws or helped\nothers exercise their right to complain about discrimination or harassment (including sexual harassment) as\ndefined by applicable federal, state or local laws are unlawful.\nReasonable Accommodation\nEmployees also have the right to reasonable workplace accommodations based on pregnancy, disability,\nreligious beliefs or any other reason required by applicable federal, state or local laws. This means employees\ncan ask for reasonable changes to their job if needed because they are pregnant or disabled or because of\ntheir religious beliefs or any other reason required by applicable federal, state or local laws.\nDiscrimination Defined\nDiscrimination under this policy generally means treating an individual differently or denying or granting a\nbenefit to an individual because of any actual or perceived protected characteristic as defined under federal,\nstate or local law/ordinance.\nHarassment Defined\nHarassment generally is defined in this policy as unwelcome verbal, visual or physical conduct that denigrates\nor shows hostility or aversion towards an individual because of any actual or perceived protected\ncharacteristic or has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance\nor creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.\n69\nHarassment can be verbal (including slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures or teasing), visual (including\noffensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, text messages, social media posts or e-\nmails) or physical conduct (including physically threatening another, blocking someone's way, etc.). Such\nconduct violates this policy, even if it does not rise to the level of a violation of applicable federal, state or\nlocal laws. Because it is difficult to define unlawful harassment, employees are expected to behave at all\ntimes in a manner consistent with the intended purpose of this policy.\nSexual Harassment Defined\nSexual harassment can include all of the above actions, as well as other unwelcome conduct, such as\nunwelcome or unsolicited sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual\nactivities and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\nsubmission to that conduct or those advances or requests is made either explicitly or implicitly a term\nor condition of an individual's employment; or\nsubmission to or rejection of the conduct or advances or requests by an individual is used as the basis\nfor employment decisions affecting the individual; or\nthe conduct or advances or requests have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an\nindividual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.\nExamples of conduct that violate this policy include:\nunwelcome flirtations, leering, whistling, touching, pinching, assault or blocking normal movement;1.\nrequests for sexual favors or demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment;2.\nobscene or vulgar gestures, posters or comments;3.\nsexual jokes or comments about a person's body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies;4.\npropositions",

Any employee who feels harassed or\ndiscriminated against is encouraged to immediately inform the alleged offender that the behavior is\nunwelcome. In many instances, the person is unaware their conduct is offensive and this action alone may\noften resolve the problem. If the informal discussion with the alleged offender is unsuccessful in remedying\nthe problem, or if you do not feel comfortable with such an approach, you should immediately report the\nconduct to your immediate supervisor, manager or company owner and the Insperity Anti-Harassment\nHotline number at 844-677-3030. We cannot resolve a harassment or discrimination problem, unless we\nknow about it. Therefore, it is your responsibility to bring those kinds of problems to our attention so we can\ntake the necessary steps to correct any problems. The report should include all facts available to you\nregarding the alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination.\nWhen you call the Insperity Anti-Harassment Hotline, please be sure to leave your name, Insperity employee\nidentification number or the last four digits of your social security number, and the name of the client\ncompany for which you work. If you wish to make an anonymous complaint, you may do so. However, the\nscope of our investigation may be limited based on the information you provide.\nConfidentiality\nAll reports of alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination will be treated seriously.\nConfidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible. However, to conduct a thorough investigation,\ncertain information may need to be disclosed to other individuals, including the alleged offender.\nConsequently, absolute confidentiality cannot be promised and cannot be guaranteed.\nInvestigative Procedure\nOnce a complaint of alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination is received, we will begin a\nprompt and thorough investigation. The investigation may include interviews with all involved employees,\nincluding the alleged harasser, and any employees who are aware of facts or incidents alleged to have\noccurred.\nFollowing an investigation, Champ Titles, Inc. and Insperity will promptly take any necessary and appropriate\ndisciplinary action. Disciplinary action will be taken if the investigation reveals that an employee has acted in\na manner that is not in alignment with the goals of this policy. Champ Titles, Inc. and Insperity may address\nany workplace issue discovered during an investigation. This may include some or all of the following steps:\nRestore any lost terms, conditions, or benefits of employment to the complaining employee.1.\nDiscipline the alleged harasser. This discipline may include written disciplinary warnings, transfer,2.\n72\ndemotion, suspension and/or termination of employment.\nIf the alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination is from a vendor, contractor, customer or\nother third party, Champ Titles, Inc. and Insperity will take appropriate action to stop the conduct.\nIf you have made a complaint but feel that the action taken in response has not remedied the situation, you\nshould make an additional complaint following the complaint procedure outlined in this policy.\nDuties of Employees and Supervisors\nAll employees of the Company, both management and non-management, are responsible for assuring that a\nworkplace free of harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination is maintained. Any employee may file a\ncomplaint regarding incidents experienced personally or incidents observed in the workplace. The Company\nstrives to maintain a pleasant work environment where all employees are able to effectively perform their\nwork without interference of any type and requests the assistance of all employees in this effort.\nAll managers and supervisors are responsible for doing all they can to prevent and discourage harassment,\nsexual harassment, and discrimination from occurring. If a complaint of harassment, sexual harassment or\ndiscrimination is raised, the individual to whom the complaint is made (i.e., supervisor, manager, company\nowner) should act promptly to notify the Insperity Anti-Harassment hotline number so an investigation may\npromptly proceed. The Company and Insperity may discipline any managers or supervisors who fail to follow\nthis policy, which discipline, may include termination.\n10-4. LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS\nChamp Titles, Inc. provides employees who are nursing with reasonable break time to express breast milk\nafter the birth of a child.\nThe break time provided must run concurrently with any other break time provided to employees but to the\nextent the lactation break does not occur during an otherwise unpaid break such time is paid.\nThe Company will make reasonable efforts to provide a private location in close proximity to the employee's\nwork area. The Company will not retaliate against employees for exercising their rights under this policy.\n10-5. JURY DUTY LEAVE\nChamp Titles, Inc. realizes that it is the obligation of all U.S. citizens to serve on a jury when summoned to do\nso. All employees will be allowed time off to perform such civic service as required by law. Employees are\nexpected, however, to provide proper notice of any request to perform jury duty as noted below and provide\nverification of their service, including fees received for jury duty service.\nEmployees also are expected to keep management informed of the expected length of jury duty service and\nto report to work for the major portion of the day if excused by the court. If the required absence presents a\nserious conflict for management, employees may be asked to try to postpone jury duty.\nThe Company",

The family members listed above are not limited to biological family\nmembers but also include step-, foster, adoptive, and half-relations; those who stand in loco parentis; and\nlegal guardians.\nUnless the employee advises the Company otherwise, the Company will assume, subject to applicable law,\nthat employees want to use available ESST for absences for reasons set forth above and employees will be\npaid for such absences to the extent they have ESST available.\nUpon request of the employee and at the end of each pay period, the Company will provide information (in\nwriting or electronically) regarding both the employee's accrued and available ESST and used ESST.\nNotice and Documentation\nWhen the need to use ESST is foreseeable, employees must provide seven (7) days advance notice to the\nemployee's supervisor. When the need to use ESST is not foreseeable, employees must provide notice to the\nemployee's supervisor as soon as practicable.\nFor ESST of more than three (3) consecutive workdays, employees may be required to provide reasonable\ndocumentation that ESST was taken for a covered reason. For example, for ESST used for reasons (1), (6), or\n(7) above, documentation signed by a licensed health care provider indicating the need for the amount of\nESST taken and that ESST was used for a covered reason under this policy and/or applicable law will be\nconsidered reasonable documentation, and such documentation need not specify the nature of the\nemployee's or the employee's family member's injury, illness, or condition, except as required by law.\nSupporting documentation will not be required for the above purposes if it would result in an unreasonable\nexpense on the employee or where the employee did not receive services from a health care professional. In\nthis event, reasonable documentation may include a written statement from the employee. For example, for\nESST used for reason (3) above, documentation signed by an employee or volunteer of a victim services\norganization, an attorney, a police officer, or an antiviolence counselor will be considered reasonable\ndocumentation, and such documentation need not specify the details of the domestic abuse, sexual assault,\nor stalking.\nPayment\nESST is paid at the same hourly rate as the employee's regular rate of pay for the hours the employee was\nscheduled to work during the time ESST is used, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Use of ESST is\nnot considered hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime.\n86\nCarryover and Payout\nEmployees receive the annual allotment of ESST in full at the beginning of each year, and therefore unused\nESST does not carry over from year to year.\nAccrued, unused ESST will not be paid upon separation.   Unused SST will be reinstated if re-employed by\nChamp Titles, Inc. within 180 days of separation. While SST is paid through Insperity, SST is solely a Champ\nTitles, Inc. policy. \nEnforcement and Retaliation\nEmployees may be subject to discipline for using ESST under this policy for purposes other than those\nprovided under this policy, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Retaliation against\nemployees who request or use ESST is prohibited. Employees have the right to file a complaint with the City\nof St. Paul Department of Human Rights and Equal Economic Opportunity if they believe they have been\ndenied ESST, retaliated against, or that their rights to ESST have been otherwise interfered with or restrained;\nor may bring a civil action in the event of retaliation. Employees also have the right to file a complaint with\nthe Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry or bring a civil action if they believe they have been denied\nESST, retaliated against, or that their rights to ESST have been otherwise interfered with or restrained.\nEmployees with questions regarding this policy can contact the Head of Human Resources and/or your\nsupervisor or Insperity human resource specialist.\n12-5.

The employee must give the Company as much notice of intent to\ntake this leave as is practicable. Any accrued paid time off which is used during this period will run\nconcurrently with leave under this policy and will not extend the length of leave.\n12-8. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE FOR EMPLOYERS COVERED BY THE FMLA\nEmployees may be entitled to a leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") and/or\nthe Minnesota Pregnancy & Parental Leave Act (\"MPPLA\"). This policy provides employees with information\nconcerning FMLA and/or MPPLA entitlements and obligations employees may have during such leaves. If\nemployees have any questions concerning FMLA and/or MPPLA leave, they should contact Supervisor.\nI. Eligibility\nFMLA leave is available to \"FMLA eligible employees.\" To be an \"FMLA eligible employee,\" the employee\nmust: 1) have been employed by the Company for at least 12 months (which need not be consecutive); 2)\nhave been employed by the Company for at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12-month period\nimmediately preceding the commencement of the leave; and 3) be employed at a worksite where 50 or more\nemployees are located within 75 miles of the worksite.\nSpecial hours of service eligibility requirements apply to airline flight crew employees.\nMPPLA is available to \"MPPLA eligible employees.\" To be an \"MPPLA eligible employee,\" the employee must:\n88\n1) have been employed by the Company for at least 12 months; 2) have worked at least half the full-time\nequivalent position for his/her job during the 12-month period immediately preceding the request for leave;\nand 3) have worked for an employer that has 21 or more employees at any single location.\nII.

The MPPLA provides\neligible employees up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for: (i) the birth or placement for adoption of a child;\nor (ii), if a female employee, for prenatal care, or incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related health\nconditions.\nMPPLA leave for the birth or adoption of a child may begin not more than 12 months after the birth or\nadoption, except that where the child must remain in the hospital longer than the mother, the leave may not\nbegin more than 12 months after the child leaves the hospital. It is the Company's policy to provide the\ngreater leave benefit provided under the FMLA or MPPLA and to run leave concurrently under the FMLA and\nMPPLA whenever possible. Leave may be taken for any one, or for a combination, of the following reasons:\nTo care for the employee's child after birth, or placement for adoption (or foster care - FMLA only);\nTo care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent (but not in-law) who has a serious health\ncondition (FMLA only);\nFor the employee's own serious health condition (including any period of incapacity due to pregnancy,\nprenatal medical care, childbirth, or related health condition) that makes the employee unable to\nperform one or more of the essential functions of the employee's job (FMLA only except MPPLA, if a\nfemale employee, for prenatal care, or incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related health\nconditions) and/or\nBecause of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter or\nparent is a military member on covered active duty or called to covered active duty status (or has been\nnotified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Reserve component of the Armed\nForces for deployment to a foreign country in support of contingency operations or Regular Armed\nForces for deployment to a foreign country (FMLA only).\nA serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves either\nan overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition\nthat either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee's job, or prevents the\nqualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities. Subject to certain conditions,\nthe continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive\ncalendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of\ncontinuing treatment, incapacity due to pregnancy or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions\nmay meet the definition of continuing treatment.\nQualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare,\naddressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, caring for the\nparents of the military member on covered active duty and attending post-deployment reintegration\n89\nbriefings.\nB. Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement (Injured Servicemember Leave) (FMLA only).\nIn addition to the basic FMLA leave entitlement discussed above, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son,\ndaughter, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember is entitled to take up to 26 weeks of leave during\na single 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Leave to care for a\nservicemember shall only be available during a single 12-month period and, when combined with other\nFMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks during the single 12-month period. The single 12-month\nperiod begins on the first day an eligible employee takes leave to care for the injured servicemember.\nA \"covered servicemember\" is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National\nGuard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient\nstatus or is on the temporary retired list, for a serious injury or illness. These individuals are referred to in this\npolicy as \"current members of the Armed Forces.\" Covered servicemembers also include a veteran who is\ndischarged or released from military service under conditions other than dishonorable at any time during the\nfive year period preceding the date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran,\nand who is who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. These\nindividuals are referred to in this policy as \"covered veterans.\"\nThe FMLA definitions of a \"serious injury or illness\" for current Armed Forces members and covered veterans\nare distinct from the FMLA definition of \"serious health condition\" applicable to FMLA leave to care for a\ncovered family member.\nC. Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules.\nFMLA leave usually will be taken for a period of consecutive days, weeks or months. However, employees are\nalso entitled to take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary due\nto a serious health condition of the employee or covered family member, or the serious injury or illness of a\ncovered servicemember. Leave due to qualifying exigencies may also be taken on an intermittent or reduced\nschedule basis.\nD.

However, if leave is solely pursuant to MPPLA,\nthe employee may be required to pay the full health insurance premium during leave.\nF. Restoration of Employment and Benefits.\nAt the end of FMLA/MPPLA leave, subject to some exceptions including situations where job restoration of\n\"key employees\" will cause the Company substantial and grievous economic injury, employees generally have\na right to return to the same or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits and other employment\nterms. The Company will notify employees if they qualify as \"key employees,\" if it intends to deny\nreinstatement and of their rights in such instances. Use of FMLA/MPPLA leave will not result in the loss of any\nemployment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an eligible employee's FMLA/MPPLA leave.\nG. Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA Leave.\n90\nEmployees requesting FMLA leave are entitled to receive written notice from the Company telling them\nwhether they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if not eligible, the reasons why they are not eligible. When\neligible for FMLA leave, employees are entitled to receive written notice of: 1) their rights and responsibilities\nin connection with such leave; 2) the Company's designation of leave as FMLA-qualifying or non-qualifying,\nand if not FMLA-qualifying, the reasons why; and 3) the amount of leave, if known, that will be counted\nagainst the employee's leave entitlement.\nThe Company may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave with appropriate written notice to employees\nprovided the Company's failure to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying at an earlier date did not cause harm or\ninjury to the employee. In all cases where leaves qualify for FMLA protection, the Company and employee can\nmutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA leave.\nIII. Employee FMLA/MPPLA Leave Obligations.\nA. Provide Notice of the Need for Leave.\nEmployees who wish to take FMLA/MPPLA leave must timely notify the Company of their need for\nFMLA/MPPLA leave. The following describes the content and timing of such employee notices.\n1. Content of Employee Notice.\nTo trigger FMLA leave protections, employees must inform their supervisor of the need for FMLA-qualifying\nleave and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave, if known. Employees may do this by either\nrequesting FMLA leave specifically, or explaining the reasons for leave so as to allow the Company to\ndetermine that the leave is FMLA-qualifying. For example, employees might explain that:\na medical condition renders them unable to perform the functions of their job;\nthey are pregnant or have been hospitalized overnight;\nthey or a covered family member are under the continuing care of a health care provider;\nthe leave is due to a qualifying exigency caused by a military member being on covered active duty or\ncalled to covered active duty status to a foreign country; or\nif the leave is for a family member, that the condition renders the family member unable to perform\ndaily activities or that the family member is a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.\nCalling in \"sick,\" without providing the reasons for the needed leave, will not be considered sufficient notice\nfor FMLA leave under this policy. Employees must respond to the Company's questions to determine if\nabsences are potentially FMLA-qualifying.\nIf employees fail to explain the reasons for FMLA leave, the leave may be denied. When employees seek leave\ndue to FMLA-qualifying reasons for which the Company has previously provided FMLA-protected leave, they\nmust specifically reference the qualifying reason for the leave or the need for FMLA leave.\n2. Timing of Employee Notice\nEmployees must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is\nforeseeable. When 30 days' notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of the need for leave is not\nforeseeable, employees must provide the Company notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable under\nthe facts and circumstances of the particular case. Employees who fail to give 30 days' notice for foreseeable\nleave without a reasonable excuse for the delay, or otherwise fail to satisfy FMLA notice obligations, may\nhave FMLA leave delayed or denied.\nEmployees must provide at least two weeks' advance notice of the need to take MPPLA leave. Employees\n91\nwho fail to give at least two weeks' notice without a reasonable excuse for the delay, or otherwise fail to\nsatisfy MPPLA notice obligations, may have MPPLA leave delayed or denied, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law.\nB. Cooperate in the Scheduling of Planned Medical Treatment (Including Accepting Transfers to Alternative\nPositions) and Intermittent Leave or Reduced Leave Schedules.\nWhen planning medical treatment, employees must consult with the Company and make a reasonable effort\nto schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the Company's operations, subject to the approval of the\nemployee's health care provider. Employees must consult with the Company prior to the scheduling of\ntreatment to work out a treatment schedule that best suits the needs of both the Company and the\nemployees, subject",

Employees must consult with the Company prior to the scheduling of\ntreatment to work out a treatment schedule that best suits the needs of both the Company and the\nemployees, subject to the approval of the employee's health care provider. If employees providing notice of\nthe need to take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical treatment neglect to fulfill this\nobligation, the Company may require employees to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the\napproval of the employee's health care provider.\nWhen employees take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable planned medical\ntreatment for the employee or a family member, including during a period of recovery from a serious health\ncondition or to care for a covered servicemember, the Company may temporarily transfer employees, during\nthe period that the intermittent or reduced leave schedules are required, to alternative positions with\nequivalent pay and benefits for which the employees are qualified and which better accommodate recurring\nperiods of leave.\nWhen employees seek intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule for reasons unrelated to the planning\nof medical treatment, upon request, employees must advise the Company of the reasons why such leave is\nmedically necessary. In such instances, the Company and employee shall attempt to work out a leave\nschedule that meets the employee's needs without unduly disrupting the Company's operations, subject to\nthe approval of the employee's health care provider.\nC. Submit Medical Certifications Supporting Need for FMLA Leave (Unrelated to Requests for Military\nFamily Leave).\nDepending on the nature of the FMLA leave sought, employees may be required to submit medical\ncertifications supporting their need for FMLA-qualifying leave. As described below, there generally are three\ntypes of FMLA medical certifications: an initial certification, a recertification and a return to work/fitness for\nduty certification.\nIt is the employee's responsibility to provide the Company with timely, complete and sufficient medical\ncertifications. Whenever the Company requests employees to provide FMLA medical certifications,\nemployees must provide the requested certifications within 15 calendar days after the Company's request,\nunless it is not practicable to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The Company will\ninform employees if submitted medical certifications are incomplete or insufficient and provide employees at\nleast seven calendar days to cure deficiencies. The Company will deny FMLA leave to employees who fail to\ntimely cure deficiencies or otherwise fail to timely submit requested medical certifications.\nWith the employee's permission, the Company (through individuals other than the employee's direct\nsupervisor) may contact the employee's health care provider to authenticate or clarify completed and\nsufficient medical certifications. If employees choose not to provide the Company with authorization allowing\nit to clarify or authenticate certifications with health care providers, the Company may deny FMLA leave if\ncertifications are unclear.\nWhenever the Company deems it appropriate to do so, it may waive its right to receive timely, complete\n92\nand/or sufficient FMLA medical certifications.\n1. Initial Medical Certifications\nEmployees requesting leave because of their own, or a covered relation's, serious health condition, or to care\nfor a covered servicemember, must supply medical certification supporting the need for such leave from their\nhealth care provider or, if applicable, the health care provider of their covered family or service member. If\nemployees provide at least 30 days' notice of medical leave, they should submit the medical certification\nbefore leave begins. A new initial medical certification will be required on an annual basis for serious medical\nconditions lasting beyond a single leave year.\nIf the Company has reason to doubt initial medical certifications, it may require employees to obtain a second\nopinion at the Company's expense. If the opinions of the initial and second health care providers differ, the\nCompany may, at its expense, require employees to obtain a third, final and binding certification from a\nhealth care provider designated or approved jointly by the Company and the employee.\n2. Medical Recertifications\nDepending on the circumstances and duration of FMLA leave, the Company may require employees to\nprovide recertification of medical conditions giving rise to the need for leave. The Company will notify\nemployees if recertification is required and will give employees at least 15 calendar days to provide medical\nrecertification.\n3. Return to Work/Fitness for Duty Medical Certifications\nUnless notified that providing such certifications is not necessary, employees returning to work from FMLA\nleaves that were taken because of their own serious health conditions that made them unable to perform\ntheir jobs must provide the Company medical certification confirming they are able to return to work and the\nemployees' ability to perform the essential functions of the employees' position, with or without reasonable\naccommodation. The Company may delay and/or deny job restoration until employees provide return to\nwork/fitness for duty certifications.\nD. Submit Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave.\nUpon request, the first time employees seek leave due to qualifying exigencies arising out of the covered\nactive duty or call to covered active duty status of a military member, the Company may require employees\nto provide: 1) a copy of the military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the\nmilitary indicating the military member is on active duty or call to covered active duty status and the dates of\nthe military member's covered active duty service; and 2) a certification from the employee setting forth\ninformation concerning the nature of the qualifying exigency for which leave is requested.

Employees shall\nprovide a copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military for leaves arising out\nof qualifying exigencies arising out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of\nthe same or a different military member.\nWhen leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, the Company may\nrequire employees to obtain certifications completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered\nservicemember. In addition, and in accordance with the FMLA regulations, the Company may request that the\ncertification submitted by employees set forth additional information provided by the employee and/or the\ncovered servicemember confirming entitlement to such leave.\nE. Substitute Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA and MPPLA Leave.\nEmployees must use any accrued paid time while taking unpaid FMLA and/or MPPLA leave.\n93\nThe substitution of paid time for unpaid FMLA and/or MPPLA leave time does not extend the length of FMLA\nleave and the paid time will run concurrently with the employee's FMLA/MPPLA entitlement.\nLeaves of absence taken in connection with a disability leave plan or workers' compensation injury/illness\nshall run concurrently with any FMLA leave entitlement. Upon written request, the Company will allow\nemployees to use accrued paid time to supplement any paid disability benefits.\nF. Pay Employee's Share of Health Insurance Premiums.\nDuring FMLA/MPPLA leave, employees are entitled to continued group health plan coverage under the same\nconditions as if they had continued to work. However, if leave is solely pursuant to MPPLA, the employee may\nbe required to pay the full health insurance premium during leave. Unless the Company notifies employees of\nother arrangements, whenever employees are receiving pay from the Company during FMLA/MPPLA leave,\nthe Company will deduct the employee portion of the group health plan premium from the employee's\npaycheck in the same manner as if the employee was actively working.\nIf FMLA/MPPLA leave is unpaid, employees must pay their portion of the group health premium through a\n''pay-as-you-go'' method.\nThe Company's obligation to maintain health care coverage ceases if the employee's premium payment is\nmore than 30 days late. If the employee's payment is more than 15 days late, the Company will send a letter\nnotifying the employees that coverage will be dropped on a specified date unless the co-payment is received\nbefore that date. If employees do not return to work within 30 calendar days at the end of the leave period\n(unless employees cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or other circumstances\nbeyond their control), they will be required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the premiums the\nCompany paid for maintaining coverage during their unpaid FMLA leave.\nIV. Coordination of FMLA/MPPLA Leave with Other Leave Policies.\nThe FMLA and MPPLA do not affect any federal, state or local law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede\nany State or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or medical leave\nrights. However, whenever permissible by law, FMLA leave will run concurrently with MPPLA and any other\nleave provided under state or local law. For additional information concerning leave entitlements and\nobligations that might arise when FMLA/MPPLA leave is either not available or exhausted, please consult the\nCompany's other leave policies in this handbook or contact Supervisor.\nV. Questions and/or Complaints about FMLA/MPPLA Leave.\nIf employees have questions regarding this FMLA/MPPLA policy, they should contact Supervisor. The\nCompany is committed to complying with the FMLA/MPPLA and, whenever necessary, shall interpret and\napply this policy in a manner consistent with the FMLA/MPPLA.\nThe FMLA makes it unlawful for employers to: 1) interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of any right\nprovided under FMLA; or 2) discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made\nunlawful by FMLA or involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA. If employees believe their\nFMLA rights have been violated, they should contact Supervisor immediately. The Company will investigate\nany FMLA complaints and take prompt and appropriate remedial action to address and/or remedy any FMLA\nviolation. Employees also may file FMLA complaints with the U.S. Department of Labor or may bring private\nlawsuits alleging FMLA violations.\nIf you have any questions about your rights or responsibilities under this policy, contact the Insperity Contact\nCenter toll free at 866-715-3552\n (select “Benefits”), weekdays between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Central time.\n94\nChamp Titles, Inc. and Insperity will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws in administering\nthis policy.\n12-9.

    "content": "Subject to certain conditions,\nthe continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive\ncalendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of\ncontinuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other\nconditions may meet the definition of continuing treatment.\nQualifying exigencies for FMLA leave may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative\nchildcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, caring\nfor the parents of the military member on covered active duty and attending post-deployment reintegration\nbriefings.\nB. Additional Military Family Leave Entitlement (Injured Servicemember Leave) (FMLA only)\nIn addition to the basic FMLA leave entitlement discussed above, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son,\ndaughter, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember is entitled to take up to 26 weeks of leave during\na single 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury or illness. FMLA leave to care for\na servicemember shall only be available during a single 12-month period and, when combined with other\nFMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks during the single 12-month period. The single 12-month\nperiod begins on the first day an eligible employee takes leave to care for the injured servicemember.\nA \"covered servicemember\" is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National\nGuard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient\nstatus, or is on the temporary retired list, for a serious injury or illness. These individuals are referred to in\nthis policy as \"current members of the Armed Forces.\" Covered servicemembers also include a veteran who is\ndischarged or released from military service under conditions other than dishonorable at any time during the\nfive year period preceding the date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran,\nand who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. These\nindividuals are referred to in this policy as \"covered veterans.\"\nThe FMLA definitions of a \"serious injury or illness\" for current Armed Forces members and covered veterans\nare distinct from the FMLA definition of \"serious health condition\" applicable to FMLA leave to care for a\ncovered family member.\nC. Intermittent Leave and Reduced Leave Schedules\nFMLA and/or NJFLA leave usually will be taken for a period of consecutive days, weeks or months. However,\nemployees also may be entitled to take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically\n100\nnecessary due to a serious health condition of the employee (FMLA only) or covered family member (both\nFMLA and NJFLA), to bond with a child after birth, placement for adoption or foster care (NJFLA only), or the\nserious injury or illness of a covered servicemember (FMLA only), or in the case of leave taken due to an\nepidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts\nto prevent spread of the communicable disease, if:\nthe covered individual provides the Company with prior notice of the leave as soon as practicable; and1.\nthe covered individual makes a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the2.\noperations of the Company and, if possible, provide the Company, prior to the commencement of the\nintermittent leave, with a regular schedule of the day or days of the week on which the intermittent\nleave will be taken (NJFLA only). Leave due to qualifying exigencies (FMLA only) may also be taken on\nan intermittent or reduced schedule basis. Under the NJFLA, intermittent leave must be taken in\nincrements of at least one (1) week and reduced schedule leave must be at least one (1) work day.\nD. No Work While on Leave\nThe taking of another job while on FMLA/NJFLA or any other authorized leave of absence is grounds for\nimmediate termination, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\nE. Protection of Group Health Insurance Benefits\nDuring FMLA leave only, eligible employees are entitled to receive group health plan coverage on the same\nterms and conditions as if they had continued to work.\nF. Restoration of Employment and Benefits\nAt the end of FMLA leave, subject to some exceptions including situations where job restoration of \"key\nemployees\" will cause the Company substantial and grievous economic injury, employees generally have a\nright to return to the same or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits and other employment\nterms. The Company will notify employees if they qualify as \"key employees,\" if it intends to deny\nreinstatement, and of their rights in such instances. A \"key employee\" is defined under the FMLA as the\nemployee among the highest paid 10 percent of all employees who are employed within 75 miles of the\nworksite. Use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the\nstart of an eligible employee's FMLA leave.\nAs with FMLA leave, at the end of NJFLA leave, subject to some exceptions, employees generally have the\nright to return to the same or equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits and other terms. However,\nunlike key employees under the FMLA who may be denied reinstatement, key employees under NJFLA may\nbe denied NJFLA leave if: 1) the employee is a salaried employee among the highest",

However,\nunlike key employees under the FMLA who may be denied reinstatement, key employees under NJFLA may\nbe denied NJFLA leave if: 1) the employee is a salaried employee among the highest paid 5 percent of\nemployees or one of the seven highest paid employees; and 2) denial of the leave is necessary to prevent\nsubstantial and grievous economic injury to the Company's operations. The Company will notify employees if\nthey qualify as key employees under the NJFLA and that leave is being denied. Nonetheless, the Company\nmay not deny reinstatement when, in the event of a state of emergency declared by the Governor or when\nindicated to be needed by the Commissioner of Health or other public health authority, the family leave is for\nan epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or\nefforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease. If the denial of the NJFLA leave occurs while the\nemployee's leave already has begun, the employee must return to work within two (2) weeks.\nG. Notice of Eligibility for, and Designation of, FMLA and NJFLA Leave\nEmployees requesting FMLA leave are entitled to receive written notice from the Company telling them\n101\nwhether they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if not eligible, the reasons why they are not eligible. When\neligible for FMLA leave, employees are entitled to receive written notice of: 1) their rights and responsibilities\nin connection with such leave; 2) the Company's designation of leave as FMLA-qualifying or non-qualifying,\nand if not FMLA-qualifying, the reasons why; and 3) the amount of leave, if known, that will be counted\nagainst the employee's leave entitlement.\nThe Company may retroactively designate leave as FMLA and/or NJFLA leave with appropriate written notice\nto employees provided the Company's failure to designate leave as FMLA- or NJFLA-qualifying at an earlier\ndate did not cause harm or injury to the employee. In all cases where leaves qualify for FMLA and/or NJFLA\nprotection, the Company and employee can mutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA\nand/or NJFLA leave.\nIII. Employee FMLA and/or NJFLA Leave Obligations\nA. Provide Notice of the Need for Leave\nEmployees who wish to take FMLA and/or NJFLA leave must timely notify the Company of their need for\nFMLA and/or NJFLA leave. The following describes the content and timing of such employee notices.\n1. Content of Employee Notice\nTo trigger FMLA and/or NJFLA leave protections, employees must inform their supervisor of the need for\nFMLA/NJFLA-qualifying leave and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave, if known. Employees may\ndo this by either requesting FMLA and/or NJFLA leave specifically, or explaining the reasons for the leave so\nas to allow the Company to determine that the leave is FMLA/NJFLA-qualifying. For example, employees\nmight explain that:\na condition renders them unable to perform the functions of their job or that they are under the\ncontinuing care of a health care provider (FMLA only);\nthey are pregnant or have been hospitalized overnight (FMLA only);\na covered family member (including partner in a civil union and parent-in-law under NJFLA) is under\nthe continuing care of a health care provider or a condition renders the family member unable to\nperform daily activities;\nthe leave is due to a qualifying exigency cause by a covered military member being on active duty or\ncalled to covered active duty status to a foreign country (FMLA only); or\na family member is a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness (FMLA only).\nCalling in \"sick,\" without providing the reasons for the needed leave will not be considered sufficient notice\nfor FMLA leave under this policy. Employees must respond to the Company's questions to determine if\nabsences are potentially FMLA-qualifying.\nIf employees fail to explain the reasons for leave, the leave may be denied. When employees seek leave due\nto FMLA/NJFLA-qualifying reasons for which the Company has previously provided FMLA/NJFLA-protected\nleave, employees must specifically reference the qualifying reason for the leave or the need for FMLA and/or\nNJFLA leave.\n2. Timing of Employee Notice\nEmployees requesting intermittent leave under the NJFLA (whether to care for a family member with a\nserious health condition or to bond with a newborn child or placement for adoption/foster care) must\nprovide 15 days’ advance notice from the first day of the intermittent leave unless an emergency or other\n102\nunforeseen circumstance precludes prior notice. Employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule the\nleave so as to not unduly disrupt the operations of the Company. Employees must, if possible, provide the\nCompany the regular schedule of the days or days of the week on which intermittent leave will be taken prior\nto the commencement of the intermittent leave\nFor all other reasons, employees must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA and/or\nNJFLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days' notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of\nthe need for leave is",

Employees must, if possible, provide the\nCompany the regular schedule of the days or days of the week on which intermittent leave will be taken prior\nto the commencement of the intermittent leave\nFor all other reasons, employees must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA and/or\nNJFLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days' notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of\nthe need for leave is not foreseeable, employees must provide the Company notice of the need for leave as\nsoon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Employees who fail to give 30\ndays' notice for foreseeable leave without a reasonable excuse for the delay, or otherwise fail to satisfy FMLA\nand/or NJFLA notice obligations, may have leave delayed or denied, to the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw.\nB. Cooperate in the Scheduling of Planned Medical Treatment (Including Accepting Transfers to Alternative\nPositions) and Intermittent Leave or Reduced Leave Schedules\nWhen planning medical treatment, employees must consult with the Company and make a reasonable effort\nto schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the Company's operations, subject to the approval of the\nemployee's health care provider. Employees must consult with the Company prior to the scheduling of\ntreatment to work out a treatment schedule that best suits the needs of both the Company and the\nemployees, subject to the approval of the employee's health care provider. If employees providing notice of\nthe need to take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical treatment neglect to fulfill this\nobligation, the Company may require employees to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the\napproval of the employee's health care provider.\nWhen employees take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable planned medical\ntreatment for the employee or a family member, including during a period of recovery from a serious health\ncondition or to care for a covered servicemember, the Company may temporarily transfer employees, during\nthe period that the intermittent or reduced leave schedules are required, to alternative positions with\nequivalent pay and benefits for which the employees are qualified and which better accommodate recurring\nperiods of leave.\nWhen employees seek intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule for reasons unrelated to the planning\nof medical treatment, upon request, employees must advise the Company of the reason why such leave is\nmedically necessary. In such instances, the Company and employee shall attempt to work out a leave\nschedule that meets the employee's needs without unduly disrupting the Company's operations, subject to\nthe approval of the employee's health care provider.\nC. Submit Medical Certifications Supporting Need for Leave (Unrelated to Requests for Military Family\nLeave)\nDepending on the nature of leave sought, employees may be required to submit medical certifications\nsupporting their need for FMLA/NJFLA-qualifying leave. As described below, there generally are three types\nof medical certifications: an initial certification, a recertification and a return to work/fitness for duty\ncertification.\nIt is the employee's responsibility to provide the Company with timely, complete and sufficient medical\ncertifications. Whenever the Company requests employees to provide medical certifications, employees must\nprovide the requested certifications within 15 calendar days after the Company's request, unless it is not\npracticable to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The Company shall inform employees\nif submitted medical certifications are incomplete or insufficient and provide employees at least seven\n103\ncalendar days to cure deficiencies. The Company will deny leave to employees who fail to timely cure\ndeficiencies or otherwise fail to timely submit requested medical certifications.\nWith the employee's permission, the Company (through individuals other than the employee's direct\nsupervisor) may contact the health care provider to authenticate or clarify completed and sufficient medical\ncertifications. If the employee chooses not to provide the Company with authorization allowing it to clarify or\nauthenticate the certification with the health care provider, the Company may deny leave if the medical\ncertification is unclear.\nWhenever the Company deems it appropriate to do so, it may waive its right to receive timely, complete\nand/or sufficient medical certifications.\n1. Initial Medical Certifications\nEmployees requesting leave because of their own, or a family member's serious health condition, or to care\nfor a covered servicemember, must supply medical certification supporting the need for such leave from their\nhealth care provider or, if applicable, the health care provider of their covered family or service member, or\nwhere the leave is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a\ncommunicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease, certification issued by a\nschool, place of care for children, public health authority, public official or health care provider, supporting\nthe need for such leave. If employees provide at least 30 days' notice of medical leave, they should submit\nthe medical certification before leave begins. A new initial medical certification will be required on an annual\nbasis for serious medical conditions lasting beyond a single leave year.\nIf the Company has reason to doubt initial medical certifications, it may require employees to obtain a second\nopinion at the Company's expense. If the opinions of the initial and second health care providers differ, the\nCompany may, at its expense, require employees to obtain a third, final and binding certification from a\nhealth care provider designated or approved jointly by the Company and the employee.\n2. Medical Recertifications\nDepending on the circumstances and duration of FMLA leave, the Company may require employees to\nprovide recertification of medical conditions giving rise to the need for leave. The Company will notify\nemployees if recertification is required and will give employees at least 15 calendar days to provide medical\nrecertification.\n3. Return to Work",

The Company will notify\nemployees if recertification is required and will give employees at least 15 calendar days to provide medical\nrecertification.\n3. Return to Work/Fitness for Duty Medical Certifications\nUnless notified that providing such certifications is not necessary, the employees returning to work from\nFMLA leave that was taken because of their own serious health conditions that made them unable to perform\ntheir job must provide the Company medical certification confirming the employee is able to return to work\nand the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the employee's position, with or without\nreasonable accommodation. The Company may delay and/or deny job restoration until the employee\nprovides a return to work/fitness for duty certification.\nD. Submit Certifications Supporting Need for Military Family Leave\nUpon request, the first time employees seek leave due to qualifying exigencies arising out of the covered\nactive duty or call to covered active duty status of a military member, the Company may require employees\nto provide: 1) a copy of the military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the\nmilitary indicating the military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status and the\ndates of the military member's covered active duty service; and 2) a certification from the employee setting\nforth information concerning the nature of the qualifying exigency for which leave is requested. Employees\n104\nshall provide a copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military for leaves arising\nout of qualifying exigencies arising out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty status\nof the same or a different military member.\nWhen leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, the Company may\nrequire employees to obtain certifications completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered\nservicemember. In addition, and in accordance with the FMLA regulations, the Company may request that the\ncertification submitted by employees set forth additional information provided by the employee and/or the\ncovered servicemember confirming entitlement to such leave.\nE. Substitute Paid Leave for Unpaid FMLA and NJFLA Leave\nEmployees must use any accrued paid time while taking unpaid FMLA and/or NJFLA leave, except that\nemployees will not be required to use any paid time off during any leave also covered under the New Jersey\nSAFE Act.\nThe substitution of paid time for unpaid FMLA and/or NJFLA leave time does not extend the length of FMLA\nand/or NJFLA leaves and the paid time will run concurrently with the employee's FMLA and/or NJFLA\nentitlement.\nDuring the leave, employees may be eligible for compensation, such as temporary disability benefits, family\nleave benefits or workers' compensation benefits. Any compensation or leave taken in connection with any\nother policy/plan shall run concurrently with any FMLA/NJFLA leave entitlement.\nUpon written request, the Company will allow employees to use accrued paid time to supplement any paid\ndisability benefits.\nF. Pay Employee's Share of Health Insurance Premiums\nAs noted above, during FMLA leave, employees are entitled to continued group health plan coverage under\nthe same conditions as if they had continued to work. Unless the Company notifies employees of other\narrangements, whenever employees are receiving pay from the Company during FMLA leave, the Company\nwill deduct the employee portion of the group health plan premium from the employee's paycheck in the\nsame manner as if the employee was actively working. If FMLA leave is unpaid, employees must pay their\nportion of the group health premium through a ''pay-as-you-go'' method.\nThe Company's obligation to maintain health care coverage ceases if the employee's premium payment is\nmore than 30 days late. If the employee's payment is more than 15 days late, the Company will send a letter\nnotifying the employees that coverage will be dropped on a specified date unless the co-payment is received\nbefore that date. If employees do not return to work within 30 calendar days at the end of the leave period\n(unless employees cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or other circumstances\nbeyond their control), they will be required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the premiums the\nCompany paid for maintaining coverage during their unpaid FMLA leave.\n[Note: If the employee is taking NJFLA leave only, the continuation requirements for group health plans\nunder the FMLA are not applicable to group health plans covered under ERISA. Therefore, the employee\nwho is on NJFLA-only leave likely will trigger COBRA requirements due to a reduction in hours worked. If\nthe employer's group health plan is covered under ERISA, the employer should coordinate with their\ninsurance broker or plan to ensure appropriate steps are taken regarding COBRA notice.]\nIV. Coordination of FMLA/NJFLA Leave with Other Leave Policies\nThe FMLA does not affect any federal, state or local law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or\n105\nlocal law that provides greater family or medical leave rights such as the NJFLA. However, whenever\npermissible by law, the Company will run FMLA leave concurrently with NJFLA and any other leave provided\nunder state or local law.

Questions and/or Complaints about FMLA/NJFLA Leave\nIf employees have questions regarding this FMLA/NJFLA policy, they should contact Supervisor. The Company\nis committed to complying with the FMLA and, whenever necessary, shall interpret and apply this policy in a\nmanner consistent with the FMLA/NJFLA.\nThe FMLA makes it unlawful for employers to: 1) interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of any right\nprovided under FMLA; or 2) discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made\nunlawful by FMLA or involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA. If employees believe their\nrights have been violated, they should contact Supervisor immediately. The Company will investigate any\ncomplaints and take prompt and appropriate remedial action to address and/or remedy any violation.\nEmployees also may file FMLA complaints with the United States Department of Labor or may bring private\nlawsuits alleging FMLA violations.\n106\nSection 14 - NEW YORK ADDENDUM\n14-1. PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS\nIn compliance with New York law, Champ Titles, Inc. will not discriminate against employees in relation to\npregnancy, childbirth or related conditions and will endeavor to provide reasonable accommodations for any\npregnancy-related conditions, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the\nCompany’s business.\nReasonable accommodations that may be provided include:\noccasional breaks to rest or drink water;1.\na modified work schedule;2.\nleave for related medical needs;3.\navailable light duty assignments; and4.\ntransfers away from hazardous duty.5.\nThe employee must cooperate in providing medical or other information that is necessary to verify the\nexistence of the pregnancy-related condition or that is necessary for consideration of the accommodation.\nSuch medical information will be kept confidential by the Company.\nThe Company will not require any employee to take leave because the employee is pregnant. If the employee\ntakes medical leave due to a pregnancy-related condition or childbirth, the Company will hold the employee’s\njob for the employee as long as the Company does for employees who take medical leave for other reasons.\nThe Company will not retaliate against any employee because the employee is pregnant or may become\npregnant or change the terms, conditions and privileges of employment because of pregnancy, childbirth or\nrelated conditions. The Company also will not refuse to hire or to promote a candidate because the individual\nis pregnant or may become pregnant.\nEmployees with questions or concerns regarding this policy or who would like to request a reasonable\naccommodation pursuant to this policy should contact the Employee's Supervisor.\n14-2.

In any civil action alleging a violation of this policy, the court may: award damages,\nincluding, but not limited to, back pay, benefits and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred to a\nprevailing plaintiff; afford injunctive relief against the Company if it commits or proposes to commit a\nviolation of the provisions of this policy; order reinstatement; and/or award liquidated damages equal to 100\npercent of the award for damages unless the Company proves a good faith basis to believe that its actions in\nviolation of this policy were in compliance with the law.\nAny act of retaliation for employees exercising any rights granted under this policy shall subject the Company\nto separate civil penalties. For the purposes of this policy, retaliation or retaliatory personnel action means\ndischarging, suspending, demoting or otherwise penalizing employees for: making or threatening to make a\ncomplaint to the Company, co-worker or to a public body, that rights guaranteed under this policy have been\nviolated; causing to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this policy; or providing information to\nor testifying before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any such violation of\na law, rule or regulation by the Company.\nEmployees with issues or concerns regarding this policy or who feel they have been subjected to any alleged\nviolation of this policy should contact your supervisor or Insperity human resource specialist.\n14-3.

Any employee who feels harassed or\ndiscriminated against, or who is aware of harassment or discrimination occurring in the workplace is\n109\nencouraged to immediately inform the alleged offender that the behavior is unwelcome. If the informal\ndiscussion with the alleged offender is unsuccessful in remedying the problem, or if you do not feel\ncomfortable with such an approach, you should immediately report the conduct to your supervisor or\nInsperity human resource specialist and the Insperity Anti-Harassment Hotline number at 844-677-3030. A\ncomplaint form is available on Insperity PremierTM to report harassment and file complaints. This form may\nbe found on Insperity Premier under Company > Forms and Policies > Company Documents.\nWe cannot resolve a harassment or discrimination problem, unless we know about it. Managers and\nsupervisors are required to report any complaint they received, or any harassment that they observe.\nTherefore, it is your responsibility to bring those kinds of problems to our attention so we can take the\nnecessary steps to correct any problems. The report should include all facts available to you regarding the\nalleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination.\nWhen you call the Insperity Anti-Harassment Hotline, please be sure to leave your name, Insperity employee\nidentification number or the last four digits of your social security number, and the name of the client\ncompany for which you work. If you wish to make an anonymous complaint, you may do so. However, the\nscope of our investigation may be limited based on the information you provide.\nExternal Complaint Procedure\nIf you believe you have been harassed, including sexual harassment, or discriminated against, you may have\nrights and remedies under federal, state, and/or local law. If you feel you’ve reported your complaint\ninternally but have not received a satisfactory response, you may file a complaint with the New York State\nDivision of Human Rights (DHR), the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or contact the county, city or\ntown in which you live to see if similar laws exist.\nThe New York State Human Rights Law (HRL), N.Y. Executive Law, art. 15, § 290 et seq., applies to all\nemployers in New York State and protects employees and covered individuals, regardless of immigration\nstatus. A complaint alleging violation of the Human Rights Law may be filed either with the New York State\nDivision of Human Rights (DHR) or in New York State Supreme Court.A complaint alleging violation of the\nHuman Rights Law may be filed either with the New York State Division of Human Rights (DHR) or in New York\nState Supreme Court.\nComplaints of sexual harassment filed with DHR may be submitted any time within three years of the\nharassment. If an individual does not file a complaint with DHR, they can bring a lawsuit directly in state court\nunder the Human Rights Law, within three years of the alleged sexual harassment. An individual may not file\nwith DHR if they have already filed a HRL complaint in state court. Complaining internally does not extend\nyour time to file with DHR or in court. The three years are counted from the date of the most recent incident\nof harassment.\nYou do not need an attorney to file a complaint with DHR, and there is no cost to file with DHR. DHR will\ninvestigate your complaint and determine whether there is probable cause to believe that sexual harassment\nhas occurred. Probable cause cases receive a public hearing before an administrative law judge. If sexual\nharassment is found at the hearing, DHR has the power to award relief. Relief varies but it may include\nrequiring your employer to take action to stop the harassment, or repair the damage caused by the\nharassment, including paying of monetary damages, punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and civil fines.\nThe United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:\nThe United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces federal anti-discrimination\nlaws, including Title VII of the 1964 federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. An individual can file a\ncomplaint with the EEOC anytime within 300 days from the most recent incident of harassment. There is no\n110\ncost to file a complaint with the EEOC. The EEOC will investigate the complaint and determine whether there\nis reasonable cause to believe that discrimination has occurred. If the EEOC determines that the law may have\nbeen violated, the EEOC will try to reach a voluntary settlement with the employer. If the EEOC cannot reach\na settlement, the EEOC (or the Department of Justice in certain cases) will decide whether to file a lawsuit in\nfederal court if the EEOC closes the charge, is unable to determine if federal employment discrimination laws\nmay have been violated, or believes that unlawful discrimination occurred by does not file a lawsuit.\nIndividuals may obtain relief in mediation, settlement or conciliation. In addition, federal courts may award\nremedies if discrimination is found to have occurred. In general, private employers must have at least 15\nemployees to come within the jurisdiction of the EEOC. An employee alleging discrimination at work can file a\n“Charge of Discrimination.”\nIf an individual filed an administrative complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights, DHR will\nautomatically file the complaint with the EEOC to preserve the right to proceed in federal court.\nLocal Protections\nMany localities enforce laws protecting individuals from sexual harassment and discrimination.

However, to conduct a thorough investigation,\ncertain information may need to be disclosed to other individuals, including the alleged offender.\nConsequently, absolute confidentiality cannot be promised and cannot be guaranteed.\nInvestigative Procedure\nOnce a complaint of alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination is received, we will begin a\nprompt and thorough investigation. All employees are required to cooperate with management during any\ninvestigation of harassment, including sexual harassment.\nThe investigation may include interviews with all involved parties, including the alleged harasser, and any\npersons who are aware of facts or incidents alleged to have occurred, and review of any information provided\nby such parties. While confidentiality will be observed in this procedure, complete confidentiality cannot be\n111\nguaranteed, however only those persons who are necessary to this process will be informed of events, and\nonly to the extent necessary.\nFollowing an investigation, Champ Titles, Inc. and Insperity will promptly take any necessary and appropriate\ndisciplinary action. Disciplinary action will be taken if the investigation reveals that an employee has acted in\na manner that is not in alignment with the goals of this policy. Champ Titles, Inc. and Insperity may address\nany workplace issue discovered during an investigation. This may include some or all of the following steps:\nIf the alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination is from a vendor, contractor, customer or\nother third party, Champ Titles, Inc. and Insperity will take appropriate action to stop the conduct.\nIf you have made a complaint but feel that the action taken in response has not remedied the situation, you\nshould make an additional complaint following the complaint procedure outlined in this policy.\nDuties of Employees and Supervisors\nAll employees of the company, both management and non-management, are responsible for assuring that a\nworkplace free of harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination is maintained. Any employee may file a\ncomplaint regarding incidents experienced personally or incidents observed in the workplace. The company\nstrives to maintain a pleasant work environment where all employees are able to effectively perform their\nwork without interference of any type and requests the assistance of all employees in this effort.\nSupervisors and managers have a special responsibility to make sure employees feel safe at work. All\nmanagers and supervisors are responsible for doing all they can to prevent and discourage harassment,\nsexual harassment, and discrimination from occurring. If a complaint of harassment, sexual harassment or\ndiscrimination is raised, the individual to whom the complaint is made (i.e., supervisor, manager, company\nowner) should act promptly to notify the Insperity Anti-Harassment hotline number so an investigation may\npromptly proceed. The company and Insperity may discipline any managers or supervisors who fail to follow\nthis policy, which discipline, may include termination.\nBystander Intervention\nAny employee witnessing harassment as a bystander is encouraged to report it. A supervisor or manager that\nis a bystander to harassment is required to report it. There are five standard methods of bystander\nintervention that can be used when anyone witnesses harassment or discrimination.\n1.       A bystander can interrupt the harassment by engaging with the individual being harassed and\ndistracting them from the harassing behavior;\n2.       A bystander who feels unsafe interrupting on their own can ask a third party to help intervene in the\nharassment;\n3.       A bystander can record or take notes on the harassment incident to benefit a future investigation;\n4.       A bystander might check in with the person who has been harassed after the incident, see how they are\nfeeling and let them know the behavior was not ok; and\n5.       If a bystander feels safe, they can confront the harassers and name the behavior as inappropriate.\nWhen confronting harassment, physically assaulting an individual is never an appropriate response.\n.\nRetaliation Prohibited\n112\nChamp Titles, Inc. and Insperity do not condone retaliation against individuals who file complaints of\nharassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination. \nExamples of retaliation may include, but are not limited to:\nDemotion, termination, denying accommodation, reduced hours, or the assignment of",

Leave taken on an intermittent basis will not result in a reduction of the total amount of\nleave to which the employee is entitled beyond the amount of leave actually taken.\nEmployee Responsibilities\nThe employee must provide 30 days' advance notice before the date leave is to begin if the qualifying event is\nforeseeable. When 30 days' notice is not practicable for reasons such as a lack of knowledge of approximately\nwhen leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, or a medical emergency, the employee must\nprovide notice as soon as practicable and generally must comply with the Company's normal call-in\nprocedures. Failure by the employee to give 30 days' advance notice of a foreseeable event may result in\npartial denial of the employee's benefits for a period of up to 30 days from the date notice is provided.\nEmployees must provide sufficient information to make the Company aware of the qualifying event and the\nanticipated timing and duration of the leave. Employees must specifically identify the type of family leave\nrequested. Employees also must provide medical certifications and periodic recertification or other\nsupporting documentation or certifications supporting the need for leave. The employee requesting PFL must\nsubmit a completed Request for Paid Family Leave or PFL-1 form and additional certification form(s) as\nfollows to the Company’s insurance carrier: 1) Bonding Certification: PFL-2 Form plus documentation; 2)\nHealth Care Provider Certification: PFL-4 Form plus Personal Health Information (PHI) Release (PFL-3 Form);\n116\nor 3) Military Qualifying Event: PFL-5 Form plus documentation. These documents are available from your\nsupervisor or Insperity human resource specialist.\nTo submit a request for PFL, employees must complete the employee's portion of the insurance carrier’s\nPFL-1 Form, and submit it to ##NYCompnayContact##. The Company will complete its section of the form and\nwill return it to the employee within three (3) business days. If the Company fails to respond, employees may\nsubmit all materials directly to the insurance carrier. Depending on the type of PFL leave employees are\nseeking, employees will be required to complete additional PFL forms as described in the communication that\nemployees will receive from the insurance carrier. Employees must submit the completed PFL forms before\nor within 30 days after the start of their leave. The insurance carrier must pay or deny leave requests within\n18 calendar days of receiving the employee's completed forms.\nJob Benefits and Protection\nDuring any PFL taken pursuant to this policy, the Company will maintain coverage under any existing group\nhealth insurance benefits plan as if the employee had continued to work. The employee must make\narrangements with their Supervisor prior to taking leave to pay their portion of any applicable health\ninsurance premiums each month.\nThe Company's obligation to maintain health insurance coverage ceases if the employee's premium payment\nis more than 30 days late. If the employee's payment is more than 15 days late, the Company will send a\nletter notifying the employee that coverage will be dropped on a specified date unless the co-payment is\nreceived before that date.\nEmployees who exercise their right to PFL will, upon the expiration of that leave, be entitled to be restored to\nthe position they held when the leave commenced, or to a comparable position with comparable benefits,\npay and other terms and conditions of employment. The taking of leave covered by PFL will not result in the\nloss of any employment benefit accrued before the date on which the leave commenced. While on PFL,\nemployees will not continue to accrue sick or vacation time.\nLeave Concurrent with FMLA\nThe Company will require the employee, who is entitled to leave under both the Family & Medical Leave Act\n(FMLA) and PFL, to take PFL concurrently with any leave taken pursuant to the FMLA. When the total hours\ntaken for FMLA in less than full-day increments reaches the number of hours in the employee's usual\nworkday, the Company may deduct one (1) day of PFL from the employee's annual available PFL.\nQuestions and/or Complaints About PFL\nIf employees have any questions regarding this policy, they should contact your supervisor or Insperity\nhuman resource specialist. For additional information concerning leave entitlements and obligations that\nmight arise when PFL is either not available or exhausted, employees should consult the Company’s other\nleave policies or contact their Supervisor. The Company is committed to complying with the PFL and will\ninterpret and apply this policy in a manner consistent with the PFL. Employees who disagree with a denial of\ntheir claim for PFL may submit their dispute to arbitration. Employees will be provided with information\nabout how to request arbitration.\nEmployees are protected from discrimination and retaliation for requesting or taking PFL. If employees\nbelieve their rights have been violated and/or they have been denied job restoration as a result of requesting\nand/or taking PFL, they must send their Insperity human resource specialist a formal request for job\nreinstatement using the Formal Request for Reinstatement Regarding Paid Family Leave (Form PFL-DC-119),\nwhich can be found in the forms section of https://www.ny.gov/PaidFamilyLeave. Employees must file the\n117\ncompleted form with the Company and send a copy to: Paid Family Leave, P.O. Box 9030, Endicott, NY\n13761-9030.\nIf the Company does not comply with the employee's request for reinstatement within 30 days, the employee\nmay file a PFL discrimination complaint with the Workers’ compensation Board using the Paid Family Leave",

You see him pronouns. I'm the deputy director for the workplace quality program. And I am so grateful that you are all here on this webinar, joining us today for a little bit of information about how we will be releasing this year's report. Before I get into we get into details of that. I will start off with housekeeping. First of all, microphones are all.\nSpeaker 1 00:02:26\nautomatically muted. This is a recorded presentation. Number one question. We've already gotten questions in the Q&A box about this. This webinar is recorded and the slide decks will be shared. So don't worry about that. If you have colleagues who can't make it today, and they registered for this webinar, they will be receiving an email with the recording and the slide deck. And then finally, please use the Q&A function for questions and comments. We know that you have two options, either the comments or the Q&A.\nSpeaker 1 00:02:57\nWe prefer the Q&A box, so in your control panel down at the bottom, you should see a Q&A box where you can add your questions there. For today, I am not presenting alone. I have my amazing colleague, Eric Bloom, who is the Vice President for Corporate Citizenship here at HRC, who will join me in this presentation, and I will be sharing a few of the logistics about the CEI launch. But with that, I will toss it over to Eric. Eric, take it away.\nSpeaker 2 00:03:26\nGood afternoon. Again, Eric Bloom, Egan Pronouns, VP of the Foundation. Really wonderful to have you all with us today. Before we dive into this year's launch strategy and the resources, we want to start by thanking you for your dedication to your work towards building fair and equal workplaces. um for your work alongside us uh in a time certainly know that uh this work isn't easy uh we know that is seemingly getting.\nSpeaker 2 00:03:57\nuh harder by the day but um on behalf of the quality program, on behalf of leadership including our president kelly robinson just a deep appreciation for your work um as you all know the corporate quality index is it represents much more than just a score um it certainly understands flex understanding of today's landscape in the commit workplaces where lgbtq plus people and frankly everybody have the opportunities um as this year has shown.\nSpeaker 2 00:04:27\nuh progress isn't linear uh organ uh and it requires sustained thoughtful action uh and really what the corporate corporate quality index is all about um over the past 23 years the cei has tracked significant shifts towards more equitable uh workplaces, In a year of heightened scrutiny around inclusion, we are just especially grateful of your CEI, your commitment to LGBTQ plus employees, and certainly for 2026, we're going to be introducing.\nSpeaker 2 00:04:60\na refined approach, but certainly to really be attuned to the rapidly evolving workplace landscape. This year's report is very important for us to go beyond just the survey results, but also to offer a clear context to how the past year has affected LGBTQ plus employees, how it has affected businesses and their work around. That's really going to be a core tenet of the report we'll talk a little bit about. Our goal is to clarify how our collective work toward inclusion and to really highlight.\nSpeaker 2 00:05:34\nthe continued importance of your partnership and feedback. Well, last year especially has been just incredibly invaluable to our work. We've had so many conversations with business leaders to really kind of talk about how we can hone CEI around broader engagement with all of you to ensure this work of the CEI continues to meet the today's business. It certainly has helped shape our launch strategy, which really has centered and will center our most important stakeholders, which are our employees and team members, and we're.\nSpeaker 2 00:06:07\nexcited to share that. We are always available to be a resource for companies as their work towards inclusion and supporting their employees. Know that your work has been impactful, as it has been impactful to the millions of workers, and certainly impactful to the bottom line. So, again, thank you so much for joining us today and thank you for your work. So, just to double click on our program.\nSpeaker 2 00:06:40\nOne of the important things that we really wanted to focus on was really just kind of having a core sort of understanding of the broader environment that businesses and LGBTQ plus workers are facing. In the early years of our work here at the Human Rights Campaign to create fair and equal workplaces, we published an annual state of the workplace report that really provided an overview of the events and updates related to work and the broader policy landscape around it.\nSpeaker 2 00:07:10\nThe cover of our 2001 report going way, way back, but the report really did serve a thousand foot perspective on what are the implications, what are the developments that really have impacted the lives of LGBT. So as part of our strategy for 2020, we're returning to that tradition with that report to provide that broader proof. It will include. shifts in the legal and policy landscape that impacts LGBTQ plus workers. It'll talk about.\nSpeaker 2 00:07:44\nnew findings from HRC's community survey, really talking about the impact that the DEI practice had, on workers, their ability to succeed, their ability to give in the workplace, and so we're excited to share some of",

We're also going to be underscoring and reiterating and providing data to support the business case, so the importance of.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:15\ntransparency, why being transparent, talking about your commitment, really help from a bottom line perspective. So last summer we released our financial performance data related to transparency and the corporate quality index for commitment inclusion. We're going to be sharing that data again. and underscoring that. And then certainly, we will be talking about policies and practices.\nSpeaker 2 00:08:45\nWe will be talking about the Corporate Equality Index findings and to really kind of understand sort of how that landscape. Just a few notes on sort of the release strategy. We know that your employees are important stakeholders. So our strategy was to accommodate that. Just from a press and media, we will be issuing a press release to promote, you know, through HRC's organizational channels.\nSpeaker 2 00:09:17\nwe're going to be reporting through our social media. And so just it's very important for us as we report to make sure that the most important stakeholders are our community, our workers have the information. We will be sharing CEI results in aggregate. really important we'll talk about that in more detail um but we will not be mentioning specific company scores or names as part of our digital report or as part of the release um and marcos, will be sharing more from on how businesses will show up as part of the um so i really just wanted.\nSpeaker 2 00:09:55\nto kind of underscore that and i think just from uh really focusing on uh targeted outreach to hr trade publications and media really making sure that uh so um that's just a broad sort of uh lay of the land on sort of strategy around the uh again we want to be mindful of the environment that we have right now we've taken a lot of steps to adjust our strategy to really try to meet them open to um to be responsive to your concerns right now but yet to be able to still provide.\nSpeaker 2 00:10:35\nAnd so just a point on timing, HRC will announce the 2026 via press release at 9am on Wednesday, February time, the results and all the information are go to that time.

On behalf of Courtney and myself, we are so thankful that you, you know, participated in the CEI this year. We've worked alongside us this entire cycle, that you bear with us on the CEI inbox as we get back to you as quickly as we can, and also in the time that it took to do the CEI this year. We really appreciate the work that you all have kind of committed to LGBTQ plus workplace inclusion and to continuing that in such a climate that we're in. As we typically do with the CEI every year, we release a release toolkit for participating companies. This year is no different. So we will share with you all a toolkit that we anticipate will be sent out by Friday, January 23rd. So not this Friday, but next.\nSpeaker 1 00:12:39\nFriday, Friday, January 23rd, we will share our release toolkit and in it we will have external components and internal components for the external components that will include a press release template. If your team would like to issue its own press release, we will also have external comms talking points that you can share in that either press release or as a, communications that you share out with just information about the history of the CEI or frequently asked questions that we get about the CEI that you can share with your team. Sample social media content that you can.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:13\nshare along with shareable images. Our CEI report cover that we will include, that will all be in the release toolkit. A quote from HRC president, Kelly Robinson that you can also include in your releases. Typically we see, releases include a CEO statement or a senior leader statement alongside Kelly's quote so we'll share that quote with you all in that document there and then finally some top line data points that you can also include if you'd like to include in your external communications. As for HRC we will be.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:43\nsharing the report launch across all of our platforms, all of our social media platforms and if you share your participation in the CEI this year we ask you to tag us in the socials and",

As for HRC we will be.\nSpeaker 1 00:13:43\nsharing the report launch across all of our platforms, all of our social media platforms and if you share your participation in the CEI this year we ask you to tag us in the socials and we will share, excuse me, we will like them. We would love to see them. Thank you. these days. We'd love to see them across all platforms these days. We're seeing quite a few on LinkedIn and folks sharing their excitement about their company participating in the CEI. And so, you know, share those out and we'll like them. Because of the volume, we are unable to.\nSpeaker 1 00:14:16\nretweet or repost, but we are able to like. So please do that and share on LinkedIn and other social media platforms with your participation in the CEI. As Eric mentioned, we know also that some companies are focusing on internal communication. So we wanted to provide you all with those resources as well. So a part of this toolkit will contain internal communications resources. One of those being for HR leaders, just guidance on how to share CEI participation.\nSpeaker 1 00:14:47\nand the company's score internally. We also know that ERG leaders and ERGs, make a big part about how the CEI happens at a lot of our corporations and so we've also included some talking points and language for ERGs to share out the excitement about having participated in the CEI this cycle and then finally we also have or we will be sharing our executive toolkit for businesses so through the CEI cycle if folks remember we shared our executive toolkit that kind of had the background rationale for the CEI a bit of you know what the pillars are and other.\nSpeaker 1 00:15:21\nadditional frequently asked questions and so that will also be included in this toolkit just in case you have some senior leaders that are still wondering what the CEI is and you wanted to include that language in your report out I'm pausing and moving slowly and deliberately on this slide which is about our CEI company listings and I first want to start off as Eric mentioned I was going to go through how companies will be listed in the CEI this cycle but I do want to share that nothing has changed from, uh what we announced in june about the way companies will be listed to now and so for our.\nSpeaker 1 00:15:58\ndigital report as eric mentioned in the digital report all results in the cei report and the press release will be reported in aggregate there will not be individual company names in the cei digital report so i know we get a few questions uh by the end of this webinar where folks are wondering if they heard that correctly but again the digital report will not company names the press release will not include company names alongside the digital report there in previous years has been a pdf appendix listing this year.\nSpeaker 1 00:16:31\nWe will not be including that appendix listing on the digital report page. That PDF listing of companies will only be shared exclusively with our HRC members, our supporters, and you all, our CEI participants. So as we release the CEI on Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern, there will likely be an email that you all receive that will have that PDF document that will contain the list of companies in the CEI this cycle. And so, again, that will only be shared with CEI participating companies and HRC members and supporters.\nSpeaker 1 00:17:08\nAnd then finally, our Employer Search Tool. This is available at hrc.org slash CEI. You can actually log in, go to hrc.org slash CEI and see the current iteration of the Employer Search Tool. But I've included a screenshot of the way that the Employer Search Tool will show up in CEI 2026. So if you're logged in or if you want to check out hrc.org slash CEI, if you look right now, listen to our corporate, underneath each of the pillars right now as it stands, there's a little checkbox of what actual policies and practices.\nSpeaker 1 00:17:40\nare in place at companies. And so we listened to our partners and said, we're going to shift that into a narrative explanation, of what each of the pillars are, but we're not going to give that level of detail. And it's really, the intention behind that was to kind of... Losing track of my words. Ultimately, to be aligned with corporations and protect companies on what practices and policies are actually in place, but also to provide that information to the LGBTQ plus community as there are job seekers, as there are consumers, as there are stakeholders and shareholders who are interested in this information.\nSpeaker 1 00:18:17\nThey use the employer search tool in order to find whether or not a company is LGBTQ plus inclusive. So we provide this employer search tool, which still will be public. And this is an example of how a company would show up. In this case, this company is an Equality 100 company. So you can see their score breakdown there, but then that paragraph narrative included there, the checkboxes are no longer included.\nSpeaker 1 00:18:48\nTo shift into a little bit about the report top line, right? Our role. been thinking about throughout this report tracking process is to make sure that LGBTQ, workers and business leaders understand how the development and workplace inclusion and how the climate has affected the workplace so that this work can continue effectively. And so our report is going to provide",

Our role. been thinking about throughout this report tracking process is to make sure that LGBTQ, workers and business leaders understand how the development and workplace inclusion and how the climate has affected the workplace so that this work can continue effectively. And so our report is going to provide an overview of shifts in legal and policy landscape. As Eric mentioned, we have our community survey climate data that we will include in this year's report. And this.\nSpeaker 1 00:19:22\nyear this data is showing us that there are shifts in corporate workplace inclusion that are associated with increased stigma and bias that then contribute to hostile workplace environments and that leads to elevated employee flight risk and a reduction in productivity. So, that data will be included in the report. Just have to wait two weeks, but there are some statistics that we will share there about the impact about workplace inclusion, how it's affected LGBTQ plus workers and business leaders. So that's going to be included in the report.\nSpeaker 1 00:19:53\nThank you so much, Eric. We also share the financial impact of the CEI. Folks, remember we shared out our financial report data in collaboration with Whistlestop Capital about the financial impact of the CEI and how CEI leaders outperform their peers in revenue, profit, and stock stability. And that over time, but in over 10 years, the top quartile CEI companies, so the companies that scored the highest in the CEI report an eight times higher.\nSpeaker 1 00:20:25\nnet income. So again, sharing that business case for participation in the CEI, but also the business case for workplace inclusion. And then finally, my most... Admired component of this report will be the CEI data, as I'm the data nerd. But really sharing the fact that one of the main things that we see in the CEI is that there is not a rollback of protections or benefits that are being provided by companies.\nSpeaker 1 00:20:57\nYou know, 98% of our CEI employers maintain LGBTQ plus non-discrimination protections. We're also seeing that inclusive benefits, domestic partner benefits, and comprehensive health benefits remain standard within our companies. We're not seeing a rollback, and we're excited to share that in this year's report. and we'll also share that there have been some some shifts in corporate transparency and that's mostly due to the climate that companies are in right now there is uh you know a shift in.\nSpeaker 1 00:21:28\nthe transparency and the ability for companies to share the way that they can be inclusive, uh and that's in large part due to the pressures that companies are facing at this time so we're excited to share that that story within the cei report in two short weeks whoops. And with that, if you all have any questions, you can reach out to us at CEI at HRC.org. Courtney and I are in that inbox mostly.\nSpeaker 1 00:21:58\nCourtney doing great work, making sure to get back to you as quickly as she can. But if you have any questions about the report release, you can reach out to us at CEI at HRC.org. And as Eric mentioned, if there are any press inquiries, if your comms teams have any questions about how to approach the report release this year, you can reach out to press at HRC.org. And I'll also share right now, again, the date for the toolkit to read your inboxes will be Friday, by Friday, January 23rd.\nSpeaker 1 00:22:30\nSo again, not this Friday, but next Friday, we will work to get you that release toolkit in your inboxes. Finally, we know that sometimes senior leaders have a few questions that they may want to reach out to HRC about, so if your senior leadership team has any questions about participating in the CEI, please reach out to us at workplace at hrc.org. Our senior leadership team is available to meet and discuss any questions that you may have, and again, you can reach out to us at workplace at hrc.org, and we'll be able to help you there.\nSpeaker 1 00:23:06\nWith that, I will pause for questions. And while folks are drafting any questions, again, I'll just reiterate the great appreciation that we at HRC have in you all, in your companies participating in the CEI. I, according to myself, just want to share a personal thank you to you all. You are likely the ones that are doing the work, doing the survey submission, emailing us, and we appreciate the work that you've done to get that survey across the finish line, but also the patients and working with us in our responses.\nSpeaker 1 00:23:37\nWe really are very grateful to have worked with you and to continue to work with you as we approach the next CEI cycle. As it stands right now, I'm not seeing any questions, so I will just end with a reminder. I'll end with a reminder that, again, the release toolkit will be shared with you by Friday, January 23rd. And then please keep all this information under embargo.\nSpeaker 1 00:24:10\nWe're asking that companies keep this under embargo until Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern. So I just want to reiterate that you may receive this or you will receive this toolkit before February 4th. But we ask to keep all communications about it on close hold until Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern. And",

The appendix PDF listing will only be shared with our CEI participants and HRC members and supporters.

The launch strategy is refined to be mindful of the current climate, focusing on employees as key stakeholders. The report's digital version and press release will only present data in aggregate, without mentioning individual company names or scores. A detailed PDF listing of companies will be shared exclusively with CEI participants, HRC members, and supporters. The public-facing Employer Search Tool will be updated to show a narrative explanation instead of detailed policy checkboxes.\n### Plan\n- [ ] Distribute the release toolkit to participating companies. -- *Marcos Garcia, Courtney* by Friday, January 23rd\n- [ ] Maintain embargo on all launch information until the official release. -- *[Insert Attendee Names]* Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern\n- [ ] Issue HRC press release and promote the launch via organizational channels and social media. -- *HRC Press Team* Wednesday, February 4th at 9 a.m. Eastern\n- [ ] Direct press inquiries to press@HRC.org. -- *Company Comms Teams*\n- [ ] Direct senior leadership questions about CEI participation to workplace@hrc.org. -- *Company Senior Leaders*\n### Discussion Points\n1. [Marcos Garcia]: A comprehensive release toolkit will support external and internal communications for participating companies.\n   - External components: press release template, external comms talking points, sample social media content, CEI report cover, a quote from HRC President Kelly Robinson, and top-line data points.\n   - Internal components: guidance for HR leaders and talking points for ERGs.\n   - Distribution by Friday, January 23rd.\n2. [Eric Bloom]: The launch strategy centers employees as the most important stakeholders and is mindful of the current environment.\n   - The CEI report and press release will share results in aggregate, without specific company scores or names.\n   - HRC will conduct targeted outreach to HR trade publications.\n3. [Marcos Garcia]: The digital CEI report and press release will not include individual company names; a PDF appendix listing companies will be shared exclusively with participants and HRC members, not on the public report page.\n4. [Marcos Garcia]: The Employer Search Tool on hrc.org/CEI will remain public but will shift to a narrative explanation of a company's inclusivity efforts rather than detailed policy checkboxes.\n   - This aims to protect companies while still providing valuable information to job seekers and consumers.\n5. [Marcos Garcia]: Companies are encouraged to tag HRC in social media posts about CEI participation; HRC will \"like\" these posts but cannot retweet or repost due to volume.\n## 2. Content and Focus of the 2026 CEI Report\n### Conclusion\nThe 2026 CEI report returns to an annual \"State of the Workplace\" format, providing broader context on the landscape for LGBTQ+ workers. It will include analyses of legal/policy shifts, new HRC community survey data linking inclusion to employee retention and productivity, a restated business case for inclusion supported by financial performance data, and the latest CEI findings. A key finding is that companies are largely maintaining non-discrimination protections and benefits, though there is a noticeable shift in corporate transparency due to external pressures.\n### Discussion Points\n1. [Eric Bloom]: The 2026 report will provide a broader \"state of the workplace\" context, reflecting HRC's early reports.\n   - Coverage of shifts in the legal and policy landscape affecting LGBTQ+ workers.\n   - New findings from HRC's community survey",

[Marcos Garcia]: The report will address the shift in corporate transparency, largely attributed to current external pressures.\n5. [Eric Bloom]: The report emphasizes collective work toward inclusion and the value of partnership and feedback from businesses.\n## 3. General Announcements and Housekeeping\n### Conclusion\nThe webinar is being recorded, and both the recording and the slide deck will be shared with all registered attendees via email. Participants were instructed to use the Q&A function for questions. Key contact emails were provided for different types of inquiries: CEI@HRC.org for general questions, press@HRC.org for media inquiries, and workplace@hrc.org for senior leadership questions.\n### Discussion Points\n1. [Marcos Garcia]: The webinar is recorded; the recording and slide deck will be shared with all registered participants.\n2. [Marcos Garcia]: Use the Q&A function in the control panel for questions and comments.\n3. [Marcos Garcia]: For general questions about the report release, contact CEI@HRC.org.\n4. [Eric Bloom]: For press-related inquiries, comms teams should contact press@HRC.org.\n5. [Marcos Garcia]: For questions from senior leadership, contact workplace@hrc.org.\n> **AI Suggestions**\n> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:\n> 1. **Date Clarity:** The toolkit distribution and embargo lift dates were cited as \"Friday, January 23rd\" and \"Wednesday, February 4th.\" In 2026, January 23rd is a Friday and February 4th is a Wednesday, but the phrasing created confusion. Confirm and communicate exact dates to all participating companies to prevent embargo violations or logistical errors.\n> 2. **PDF Appendix Distribution Process:** The PDF appendix listing companies will be shared exclusively with CEI participants, HRC members, and supporters, but the distribution mechanism is unclear. Specify whether it will be sent automatically (and to whom), available via a secure portal, or require a request, and clarify access for HRC members/supporters.\n> 3. **Transparency Shift Examples:** The report references a \"shift in corporate transparency\" due to external pressures without concrete examples. Provide specifics (e.g., changes in marketing disclosures, internal comms, public policy advocacy, or reporting practices) to prepare companies for internal and external questions.",
